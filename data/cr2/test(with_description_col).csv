The binary rating of 0 confirms this status. Several key ratios highlight the company's creditworthiness. The current ratio of 2.0964 indicates that PVH Corp has a relatively healthy liquidity position, as it possesses more than twice the current assets compared to its current liabilities. However, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4048 suggests that the company relies significantly on debt to finance its operations and expansion. Furthermore, the debt/equity ratio of 0.7104 denotes a relatively high level of leverage, potentially increasing the company's financial risk.

PVH Corp's profitability ratios also contribute to its overall credit status. While the gross margin of 53.768% indicates a strong ability to generate revenue after accounting for direct costs, the company's operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin of 10.9267% demonstrate a relatively low profitability level. This could be due to factors such as high operating expenses or a competitive market. Additionally, the pre-tax profit margin and net profit margin stand at 8.9873% and 6.97% respectively, further indicating a lack of profitability.

The asset turnover ratio of 0.7816 suggests that PVH Corp is not generating sufficient sales from its total assets, potentially indicating inefficiencies in asset utilization. The return on equity (ROE) of 13.3372% is relatively modest, suggesting that the company is generating an acceptable return for its shareholders. However, the negative return on tangible equity (-33.6978%) indicates that the company is not effectively utilizing its tangible assets to generate returns. The return on assets (ROA) of 5.6107% is relatively low, indicating that the company's overall asset management and utilization are not optimal.

Furthermore, the return on investment (ROI) of 7.9389% suggests that PVH Corp's investments are not generating substantial returns. Lastly, the operating cash flow per share of 0.9784 and free cash flow per share of 0.4576 indicate that the company has limited cash flow available to reinvest in its operations or distribute to its shareholders.

In conclusion, based on the provided financial indicators, PVH Corp has a poor credit rating. The company's high level of debt, low profitability, inefficient asset utilization, and limited cash flow contribute to its overall credit status."

Additionally, the debt-related ratios provide further evidence of the poor credit status. The long-term debt to capital ratio stands at 0.475, suggesting a relatively high level of debt in relation to the company's capital structure.

Lastly, the return on investment (ROI) of 8.7299% indicates a moderate level of return on the company's investments. However, the relatively low operating cash flow per share and free cash flow per share signify limited cash generation and potential constraints on the company's ability to invest in future growth opportunities.

Despite a negative operating margin, the company manages to maintain a healthy current ratio of 1.267 and a low long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.373. Additionally, the debt/equity ratio of 0.6573 indicates that Boston Scientific Corp. has a moderate level of debt compared to its equity.

Furthermore, the company demonstrates a strong gross margin of 70.0542%, which suggests efficient cost management and effective pricing strategies. Although the pre-tax and net profit margins are negative, they are relatively low at -6.897% and -1.6125% respectively, indicating that Boston Scientific Corp. is still able to generate some profits despite the challenges it faces.

In terms of efficiency, the asset turnover ratio of 0.4335 suggests that the company effectively utilizes its assets to generate revenue. Moreover, the return on tangible equity of 2.3578% indicates that Boston Scientific Corp. generates a satisfactory return on its invested capital.

However, some areas of concern include negative return on equity (-1.843%) and negative return on assets (-0.699%), which imply that the company is not effectively utilizing its shareholders' investments or its total assets to generate returns.

Overall, while Boston Scientific Corp. exhibits certain weaknesses in profitability and utilization of capital, its strong current ratio, low debt levels, and healthy gross margin contribute to its good credit status. The company should focus on improving its profitability and efficiency to enhance its creditworthiness further."

Co., it is evident that the company's overall credit status is poor. The current ratio, which measures the company's ability to pay its short-term obligations, is 2.0342, indicating that it has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities. However, the long-term debt to capital ratio is 0.3925, suggesting that the company relies heavily on debt financing.

The debt/equity ratio of 0.6462 further supports this assessment, indicating that Glatfelter has a significant amount of debt in comparison to its equity. This could pose a risk to the company's financial stability, as a higher debt load increases the likelihood of financial distress. 

Moreover, the gross margin is 12.6703, which implies that the company has a relatively low profitability on its products after accounting for the cost of production. The operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, and pre-tax profit margin are all around 5%, indicating that the company has limited profitability and efficiency in its operations.

The return on equity (ROE) of 9.8116 suggests that Glatfelter is generating a modest return on the shareholders' investment, while the return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 13.6376 indicates a slightly higher return on the tangible assets owned by the company. However, these figures still fall below the industry average and demonstrate that Glatfelter's profitability is subpar.

In conclusion, Glatfelter (P.H.) Co.'s credit status is poor due to its heavy reliance on debt, low profitability margins, and inadequate return on investment. The company needs to address these issues in order to improve its financial stability and creditworthiness."

The current ratio, which measures the company's ability to pay off its short-term obligations, is 1.4679. While this indicates that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, it is not a strong ratio and suggests some level of risk.

The long-term debt to capital ratio is -0.1523, indicating that the company has negative long-term debt relative to its capital. This could be seen as a positive indicator, suggesting a lower risk of default. However, the negative debt to equity ratio of -0.1324 contradicts this, and it is unclear why the company has negative values for both of these ratios.

The gross margin, operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin are 26.2654, 8.6121, 8.6121, 13.3229, 6.8557, and 3.4913 respectively.

The current ratio of 1.3266 indicates that Suburban Propane Partners may struggle to meet its short-term obligations, as a ratio below 2 is generally considered weak. Furthermore, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.5489 suggests a relatively high level of debt compared to the company's capital, which could pose a risk to its financial stability.

The debt/equity ratio of 1.2166 further emphasizes the company's reliance on debt financing, potentially increasing its financial vulnerability. Additionally, the negative return on tangible equity of -22.2234 indicates that the company is generating losses from its core operations.

The debt/equity ratio of -1.0794 is unusual and may indicate a negative shareholder's equity, which further highlights the financial challenges faced by the company. The gross margin of 10.9945 and operating margin of 3.9462 show that the company's profitability is relatively low, with limited ability to generate profits from its operations.

Furthermore, the return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) are negative, indicating that the company is not effectively utilizing its shareholders' investments or tangible assets to generate profits. The positive return on assets (ROA) may indicate some level of operational efficiency, but it is overshadowed by the poor credit status overall.

The debt/equity ratio of 2.1428 further highlights the company's high level of debt relative to its equity. This could indicate a higher risk for lenders and investors, as a higher ratio suggests that the company may have difficulties in repaying its debt obligations.

The gross margin, operating margin, and EBIT margin all indicate that the company's profitability is relatively low. With a net profit margin of 7.8756, Amkor Technology, Inc. may struggle to generate significant profits from its operations.

The ROE of 36.4621 and ROTE of 37.2534 suggest that the company's assets and tangible assets are not being efficiently utilized to generate profits.

This conclusion is drawn by analyzing various aspects of the company's financial health.

The current ratio of 1.4843 indicates that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. With a debt/equity ratio of 1.3812, it suggests that the company relies heavily on debt to finance its operations, which can be a risky strategy. Additionally, the long-term debt/capital ratio of 0.5777 further emphasizes the company's reliance on borrowed funds.

The gross margin of 29.5466, while not an extremely low value, indicates that the company may be struggling to generate sufficient profit from its sales. This is reinforced by the low operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin, all hovering around 3.9383 and 6.0757 respectively. These margins suggest that the company's profitability is limited.

Furthermore, the return on equity (ROE) of 5.042% and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of -10.9492% indicate that the company is not efficiently utilizing its shareholders' investments. The return on assets (ROA) of 1.7675% and return on investment (ROI) of 2.1294% also suggest that the company is not generating significant returns on its assets and investments.

While the asset turnover ratio of 1.6269 demonstrates that the company is utilizing its assets relatively well, the low pre-tax profit margin of 1.9371% and net profit margin of 1.0865% indicate that the company is struggling to generate substantial profits.

Lastly, the operating cash flow per share of 0.153 and free cash flow per share of 0.1352 suggest that the company's cash flows may be limited, which can further hinder its financial stability.

Considering these indicators collectively, it is evident that Sprouts Farmers Market Holdings, LLC faces a poor credit status. The company's heavy reliance on debt, limited profitability, inefficient use of investments, and potentially constrained cash flows contribute to this assessment."

The company's current ratio of 0.6041 indicates that it may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. Additionally, its long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.5356 suggests a relatively high level of debt compared to its capital structure.

The debt/equity ratio of 1.1535 further supports the notion of a poor credit status, as it indicates that the company relies heavily on debt financing rather than equity. This can increase the financial risk for creditors and investors.

Furthermore, Comstock Resources Inc. exhibits negative profit margins across various measures, including operating margin, EBIT margin, and net profit margin. These negative margins indicate that the company is not generating sufficient profits from its operations, which can make it challenging to service its debt obligations and maintain a healthy credit profile.

The low return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of -3.2258 suggest that the company is not effectively utilizing its shareholders' equity to generate profits. Similarly, the negative return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI) indicate that the company's assets are not generating sufficient returns.

These margins reflect Sanofi's ability to generate profits from its operations and effectively control its expenses.

Furthermore, Sanofi's asset turnover ratio of 0.3467 indicates its ability to efficiently utilize its assets to generate sales. Although the company's return on equity (ROE) stands at 6.7966%, which is relatively low, its return on tangible equity (ROTE) is significantly higher at 86.3991%. This suggests that Sanofi's profitability is primarily driven by its tangible assets rather than financial leverage.

Additionally, the return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI) of Sanofi are 4.0337% and 5.7469% respectively, indicating reasonable returns on the company's assets and investments.

The long-term debt to capital ratio of 1.6079 suggests that AutoZone Inc. relies moderately on debt to finance its operations. This indicates that the company has a reasonable balance between debt and equity in its capital structure.

The negative debt/equity ratio of -2.6723 seems unusual at first glance, but it can be attributed to the company having negative equity. This could be due to accounting factors or specific financial circumstances. It is worth noting that negative values in financial ratios are not always indicative of poor creditworthiness.

AutoZone Inc.'s gross margin of 51.0278 indicates that the company is effectively managing its production costs and pricing strategy. The operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin, all at 18.5161 and 21.0576, respectively, suggest that the company is generating healthy profits from its operations.

With an asset turnover of 1.3754, AutoZone Inc. is effectively utilizing its assets to generate revenue. This indicates that the company is efficiently managing its resources and generating sales.

However, the negative return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of -67.6888 and -54.5306, respectively, suggest that the company is not generating positive returns for its shareholders. This could be due to various reasons, such as high debt levels or losses incurred in previous periods.

The positive return on assets (ROA) of 14.4639 indicates that AutoZone Inc. is able to generate profits from its assets, which is a positive sign for creditors.

The return on investment (ROI) of 41.1451 indicates that AutoZone Inc. is generating a significant return on the investments made in the company.

In conclusion, AutoZone Inc. demonstrates a good credit status overall. It effectively manages its costs, generates profits, and efficiently utilizes its assets. However, the negative ROE and ROTE indicate that the company needs to focus on improving returns for its shareholders."

The current ratio of 0.5635 indicates that JetBlue may struggle to meet its short-term obligations. A ratio below 1 suggests that the company may have difficulty paying off its current liabilities with its current assets. 

Furthermore, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4979 suggests that JetBlue relies heavily on debt to finance its operations. This indicates a higher risk for the company, as it may face challenges in meeting its long-term debt obligations.

The debt/equity ratio of 1.2113 also indicates a higher reliance on debt, which could increase financial vulnerability. A higher debt/equity ratio suggests that the company has more debt relative to its equity, which may increase the risk of default.

Additionally, the net profit margin of 3.0877 and return on equity of 7.8725 indicate relatively low profitability. These figures suggest that JetBlue may struggle to generate sufficient profits from its operations and may not be maximizing returns for its shareholders.

Although the gross margin of 49.2005 and EBITDA margin of 13.4902 indicate moderate profitability, the overall financial indicators paint a picture of a company with poor credit.

The company's binary rating of 0 indicates a negative assessment. Several key ratios and margins further support this conclusion.

The current ratio of 1.7909 suggests that Leidos Holdings may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations, as a ratio below 2 is generally considered weak. Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4549 indicates a relatively high level of debt, which could negatively impact the company's financial stability.

Furthermore, the debt/equity ratio of 0.8357 suggests that Leidos Holdings relies heavily on debt financing, potentially increasing its financial risk. The low gross margin of 13.258 and operating margin of 2.8323 indicate that the company may struggle to generate profits from its operations.

The company's gross margin of 30.3099 and operating margin of 13.1769 indicate that DaVita has relatively low profitability compared to its revenue and operating expenses. This is further supported by the net profit margin of 5.3846, which suggests that the company's ability to generate profits from its operations is limited.

DaVita's return on equity (ROE) of 16.1537 is positive, indicating that it generates a reasonable return on the shareholders' investment. However, the return on tangible equity (ROTE) of -11.2181 suggests that the company may not be efficiently utilizing its tangible assets to generate profits.

The asset turnover ratio of 0.688 indicates that DaVita's assets are not generating significant revenue. This could be a sign of inefficiency or underutilization of its resources.

Overall, DaVita Inc. faces significant challenges in terms of its financial health and creditworthiness. The company's poor credit rating is primarily attributed to its weak liquidity position, high debt levels, and relatively low profitability."

The company's current ratio, which measures its ability to meet short-term obligations, is 1.4382. This indicates that Moody's has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities. Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 1.3209 suggests that the company has a manageable level of debt in relation to its capital.

The debt/equity ratio, however, is reported as -4.1542, which seems unusual. This negative value may indicate that the company has negative equity, meaning its liabilities exceed its assets. This could potentially be a cause for concern, as it suggests financial instability.

On the profitability side, Moody's demonstrates strong margins across various measures. The gross margin, operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin are all reported as positive figures. These margins indicate that the company is generating healthy profits relative to its revenues and operating costs.

However, the return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) are negative, with values of -172.0511 and -55.0445, respectively. These negative values suggest that the company is not efficiently utilizing its equity or tangible assets to generate returns for its shareholders.

The asset turnover of 0.7999 indicates that Moody's is generating $0.7999 in sales for every dollar of assets it owns, which is relatively low. 

In conclusion, while Moody's Corporation demonstrates strong profitability and liquidity indicators, the negative values for debt/equity ratio, ROE, and ROTE raise concerns about its financial stability and efficiency. It is important for investors to carefully assess these factors when considering the creditworthiness of the company."

This conclusion is drawn from various factors including the company's current ratio of 1.2455, which indicates a somewhat limited ability to cover short-term liabilities with its current assets. Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.5735 suggests a significant reliance on borrowed funds to finance its operations. 

The high debt to equity ratio of 2.733 further emphasizes the company's heavy debt burden, indicating that it has a substantial amount of debt in relation to its shareholders' equity. This can be concerning as it suggests a higher risk for creditors and investors. 

The low gross margin of 16.9097 indicates that the company is not generating a significant profit from its sales after accounting for the cost of goods sold. The operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin all hover around 3.168 to 3.9093, indicating relatively low profitability and efficiency in the company's operations. 

The pre-tax profit margin and net profit margin are also low at 1.8158 and 1.6395 respectively, indicating that the company's profitability is further impacted by expenses such as taxes and interest payments. 

The return on equity (ROE) of 14.2376 and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 15.1023 suggest that the company is not generating significant returns for its shareholders. The return on assets (ROA) of 3.276 indicates that the company's assets are not being efficiently utilized to generate profits. 

The return on investment (ROI) of 6.0729 suggests that the company is not generating substantial returns on the investments made in its operations. 

Furthermore, negative operating cash flow per share of -5.8565 and free cash flow per share of -4.4492 indicate that the company is not generating sufficient cash to cover its operating and capital expenses. 

Overall, the combination of these indicators paints a picture of poor credit for Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. The company is facing challenges in terms of profitability, efficiency, and managing its debt, which may impact its ability to attract investments and secure favorable credit terms."

In terms of liquidity, the company's asset turnover ratio of 0.2869 suggests that it may need to improve its efficiency in utilizing its assets to generate sales.

The debt/equity ratio of 1.2417 further supports this notion, indicating a high level of debt relative to equity.

The gross margin of 25.7077 reveals that the company is facing challenges in generating profits after accounting for the cost of goods sold. The operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin, all at 6.9942 and 19.7929 respectively, indicate low profitability. Furthermore, the pre-tax profit margin of -7.1153 suggests that the company is operating at a loss before taxes.

Despite these challenges, NRG Energy Inc. manages to maintain a positive net profit margin of 2.0707, indicating some level of profitability, albeit minimal. The return on equity (ROE) of 2.5688 and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 4.2705 signify a relatively low return on the shareholders' investment. The return on assets (ROA) of 0.7323 and return on investment (ROI) of 1.1153 also reflect underperformance.

Additionally, the asset turnover of 0.3375 implies that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate revenue. The negative operating cash flow per share of -1.5516 and free cash flow per share of -8.4973 indicate a cash flow deficit, potentially limiting the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or service its debt.

In conclusion, NRG Energy Inc. exhibits several concerning financial indicators, resulting in a poor credit rating. The company faces challenges in profitability, liquidity, and debt management, which may impact its ability to meet financial obligations and generate sustainable growth."

Although the operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin are all at 7.9266, which could be improved, they are still at a reasonable level. The pre-tax profit margin of 2.3056 and net profit margin of 13.0649 demonstrate the company's ability to generate profits from its operations.

Mondelez International's return on equity (ROE) of 1.8697 and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of -2.4106 show mixed results. While the ROE is positive, indicating a return on investment for shareholders, the negative ROTE suggests that the company's tangible assets are not generating sufficient returns.

The debt/equity ratio of 0.8171 also signifies that the company relies heavily on debt financing.

Furthermore, the gross margin of 43.4948 suggests that the company has a relatively low profitability on its sales. The operating margin, EBIT margin, and pre-tax profit margin are all around 10%, indicating that the company's operating efficiency and profitability are relatively low. The net profit margin of 7.4271 reinforces this observation.

The return on equity (ROE) of 10.001 and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 39.784 are relatively low, suggesting that the company is not generating sufficient returns for its shareholders.

Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4423 suggests that the company relies heavily on debt to finance its operations, which can increase its financial risk.

The debt/equity ratio of 0.7932 further highlights the company's reliance on borrowed funds, indicating that a significant portion of its capital structure is comprised of debt. This can make it challenging for Belden Inc. to attract investors and may limit its financial flexibility.

Furthermore, the gross margin of 28.7708 and the operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin of 8.7773 and 11.4431 respectively, reveal that the company's profitability is relatively low.

While the return on equity (ROE) of 14.5862 and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 46.3773 appear relatively favorable, they should be interpreted with caution. The ROE measures the company's ability to generate profits from shareholders' investments, while ROTE considers only the tangible assets. However, the low net profit margin of 6.0751 suggests that the company's overall profitability is modest.

Overall, Belden Inc.'s poor credit rating can be attributed to its low liquidity, heavy reliance on debt, and relatively low profitability. These factors indicate potential financial difficulties and may hinder the company's ability to meet its financial obligations and attract investors. It is crucial for Belden Inc. to address these issues and improve its credit status to ensure long-term financial stability and growth."

However, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4604 indicates a relatively high level of debt in relation to the capital invested in the business. This could be a cause for concern as it suggests the company may have difficulties in meeting its long-term debt obligations.

The debt/equity ratio of 7.5627 further confirms the company's high debt burden, indicating that it has a significant amount of debt relative to its equity. This can be concerning as it may limit the company's financial flexibility and increase its risk of default.

Although Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. has a positive gross margin of 50.1353, indicating that it is generating a profit from its sales, the operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, and pre-tax profit margin are all relatively low. This suggests that the company's profitability is not strong, and it may struggle to generate consistent earnings.

The return on equity (ROE) of 96.5894 is exceptionally high, but this may be due to a high level of debt in the capital structure rather than efficient use of equity.

With an asset turnover of 1.8121, Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. is relatively efficient in generating sales from its assets. However, the net profit margin of 3.8044 is quite low, indicating that the company's ability to convert sales into profit is weak.

These margins, which range from 28.1684% to 81.0808%, indicate eBay's ability to generate earnings from its operations and effectively control costs.

However, there are certain areas of concern. The return on equity (ROE), return on tangible equity (ROTE), return on assets (ROA), and return on investment (ROI) metrics all show negative values, indicating that the company's profitability on invested capital and shareholder equity is currently in a loss-making territory. This could be attributed to various factors, such as increased expenses or impairment charges.

Despite these concerns, eBay Inc. maintains a positive operating cash flow with a per-share value of 0.7337 and a free cash flow per share of 0.7529.

The company's overall creditworthiness is determined by various factors such as liquidity, profitability, leverage, and efficiency.

Firstly, the current ratio of 5.318 indicates that CMC has a strong liquidity position, which means it has sufficient short-term assets to cover its immediate liabilities. This is a positive aspect of their credit status.

However, when considering leverage, CMC's long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.3182 suggests that they have a moderate level of debt. Additionally, the debt to equity ratio of 0.5005 indicates that the company has a significant reliance on debt to finance its operations. These factors contribute to their poor credit rating as higher debt levels increase the risk of default.

Profitability is another crucial aspect of creditworthiness. CMC's gross margin of 48.9727% indicates that the company has a healthy profit margin. However, the operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin, all around 17%, indicate that CMC's profitability is moderate. This may be a concern for lenders as it suggests that the company may struggle to generate sufficient profits to meet its financial obligations.

Efficiency is measured by asset turnover, which indicates how well a company utilizes its assets to generate sales. CMC's asset turnover of 0.7852 suggests that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets. This inefficiency may impact its ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its financial commitments.

Overall, while CMC has a strong liquidity position, its high debt levels and moderate profitability and efficiency contribute to its poor credit status.

The debt/equity ratio of 0.8146 further supports the notion that Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. has a poor credit status. This ratio indicates that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which can be a cause for concern for creditors. Moreover, the negative return on tangible equity of -105.8689 suggests that the company's assets are not generating sufficient returns, further exacerbating its poor credit position.

With a gross margin of 13.2078 and operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, and pre-tax profit margin all at 2.84, it suggests that the company struggles to generate significant profits from its operations. The net profit margin of 1.4362 further reinforces this trend.

Furthermore, the company's return on investment (ROI) and return on equity (ROE) are relatively low at 5.9348 and 9.7597, respectively. These figures indicate that the company's assets and equity generate below-average returns.

Additionally, the negative operating cash flow per share (-0.5376) and free cash flow per share (-1.2538) indicate that the company may be experiencing financial difficulties and is not generating sufficient cash flow to cover its operating and investment activities.

In summary, the overall credit status of Boise Cascade Company is poor, as reflected by its weak financial ratios, low profitability margins, and negative cash flow figures."

This suggests that the company is capable of meeting its financial obligations in the near future.

Furthermore, Avista Corp. has a relatively low long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.514, which indicates that it has a relatively low level of long-term debt in relation to its total capital. This suggests that the company has managed its debt levels effectively and is not overly reliant on borrowed funds.

The company also demonstrates strong profitability, with a gross margin of 100.0% and operating, EBIT, EBITDA, pre-tax profit, and net profit margins of 14.0762%, 14.0762%, 21.97%, 9.8884%, and 6.1875% respectively.

The company's binary rating of 0 indicates a negative credit assessment. Several key ratios and margins further support this assessment.

The current ratio of 2.1128 suggests that the company has a relatively strong ability to meet its short-term obligations. However, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.5583 and the debt/equity ratio of 1.2814 indicate a significant reliance on debt financing. This high level of debt can be concerning as it increases the financial risk for the company.

The gross margin, operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin all indicate that the company's profitability is relatively low. With a gross margin of 5.3665 and a net profit margin of 2.1454, Pilgrim's Pride Corporation faces challenges in generating significant profits from its operations.

The return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) provide insight into the company's ability to generate returns for its shareholders. With an ROE of 19.1466 and an ROTE of 19.988, the company appears to be performing well in this aspect. However, it is essential to note that other financial indicators indicate a poor credit status overall.

The return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI) indicate that the company's efficiency in utilizing its assets and investments to generate profits is relatively low. A ROA of 5.9729 and an ROI of 8.4574 suggest that Pilgrim's Pride Corporation may not be fully optimizing its resources.

Lastly, the operating cash flow per share and free cash flow per share indicate the company's ability to generate cash from its operations. With operating cash flow per share of 1.3711 and free cash flow per share of 1.6028, the company appears to have a positive cash flow position.

In conclusion, based on the provided financial indicators, Pilgrim's Pride Corporation has a poor credit status. The company faces challenges in terms of profitability, debt management, and return on investment. It is crucial for the company to address these issues to improve its creditworthiness and financial performance."

The binary rating of 0 confirms this assessment. Several key ratios highlight the challenges faced by the company in terms of its financial health and profitability.

The current ratio of 1.7492 indicates that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4683 and the debt/equity ratio of 0.8819 suggest that the company has a significant amount of debt relative to its capital structure. This can increase financial risk and make it harder for the company to obtain additional financing.

The negative operating margin, EBIT margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin all indicate that the company is experiencing operating losses and struggling to generate profits. The return on equity (ROE), return on tangible equity, return on assets (ROA), and return on investment (ROI) are all negative as well, further highlighting the company's poor financial performance.

Although the gross margin and EBITDA margin are positive, they are not sufficient to offset the overall negative profitability of the company. The asset turnover ratio of 0.574 suggests that the company's assets are not being efficiently utilized to generate revenue.

Lastly, the negative free cash flow per share indicates that the company is not generating enough cash to cover its capital expenditures, potentially limiting its ability to invest in future growth opportunities.

In conclusion, the overall credit status of Nabors Industries Inc. is poor, as indicated by its weak financial indicators and negative profitability. The company faces challenges in generating profits, managing its debt, and maintaining sufficient liquidity."

Several key ratios and margins indicate potential financial risks and weaknesses.

Firstly, the current ratio of 2.9562 suggests that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. A ratio below 3 is generally considered unfavorable as it indicates a potential liquidity issue.

Furthermore, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4878 indicates that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which could increase financial risk and vulnerability to economic downturns. Additionally, the debt/equity ratio of 0.9584 suggests that the company has a relatively high level of debt compared to its equity, further indicating weak financial health.

Moreover, the net profit margin of 16.8733 demonstrates that the company has a low profitability level, which may be a result of low gross margin (32.8577) and operating margin (24.2495). These margins indicate that the company may have difficulties generating profits from its operations.

On the positive side, some ratios such as return on equity (33.3384) and return on tangible equity (45.5001) indicate a relatively favorable performance in terms of generating returns for shareholders. However, these positive indicators are outweighed by the poor performance in liquidity, profitability, and debt management.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of various financial indicators, the overall credit status of Compass Minerals International, Inc is poor. The company faces challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, and debt management, which may impact its ability to meet its financial obligations and generate sustainable profits in the long run."

Furthermore, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.744 and debt/equity ratio of 3.3187 indicate a significant reliance on debt to finance its operations. This could increase the company's financial risk and make it more vulnerable to changes in interest rates or economic downturns.

The gross margin of 57.1054% suggests that the company has a relatively high cost of goods sold, which could impact profitability. However, the operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin of 49.417% and 55.9581% respectively, indicate that the company is generating healthy operating profits.

The pre-tax profit margin and net profit margin of 33.0458% and 21.0751% respectively, suggest that the company has a moderate level of profitability. However, the asset turnover ratio of 0.4347 indicates that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate revenue.

The company's current ratio of 0.6392 suggests that it may have some difficulty in meeting its short-term obligations. However, it is important to note that this ratio alone does not provide a complete picture of the company's overall credit status.

The long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.6703 indicates that Telefonica SA relies moderately on debt to finance its operations. Meanwhile, the debt/equity ratio of 2.4216 shows that the company has a relatively high level of debt compared to its equity. This could be a potential concern for creditors.

On the positive side, Telefonica SA exhibits strong profitability with gross, operating, EBIT, EBITDA, pre-tax, and net profit margins ranging from 9.8461% to 70.9471%. These margins suggest that the company is effectively managing its costs and generating healthy returns on its sales and investments.

The asset turnover ratio of 0.4848 implies that Telefonica SA generates less revenue from its assets, indicating room for improvement in its efficiency in utilizing its assets to generate sales.

In terms of returns, the company demonstrates a solid return on equity (ROE) of 19.0002%. However, the negative return on tangible equity (-20.1754%) suggests that the company may not be generating positive returns on its tangible assets.

In conclusion, Telefonica SA has a ""Good credit"" rating overall. While some areas such as the current ratio and debt/equity ratio raise concerns, the company's strong profitability and positive cash flow indicators contribute to its overall creditworthiness.

Several key ratios further support this conclusion. The current ratio, which measures a company's ability to meet short-term obligations, stands at 1.7048. While this suggests the company is able to cover its immediate liabilities, it is not an exceptional ratio and may indicate some vulnerability. 

Furthermore, Coeur Mining's debt-related ratios are also suboptimal. The long-term debt to capital ratio is 0.062, indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its capital structure. The debt/equity ratio, at 0.1212, suggests the company relies more on equity financing than debt, which is generally seen as positive. However, these ratios alone do not paint a complete picture of the company's financial health.

Profitability measures provide additional insight. The gross margin, operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin all indicate a moderate level of profitability. However, none of these margins are particularly strong, with the net profit margin at 5.4358%, indicating relatively low profitability compared to its peers.

The return on equity (ROE), return on tangible equity, return on assets (ROA), and return on investment (ROI) are all below average. These ratios reflect the company's ability to generate returns from its equity, tangible equity, assets, and investments, respectively. Coeur Mining's ratios in these areas suggest that it is not effectively utilizing its resources to maximize returns.

In summary, Coeur Mining, Inc's overall credit status is poor. The company's financial indicators, including profitability and return ratios, highlight areas of concern.

Several factors contribute to this assessment.

Firstly, the current ratio of 1.525 indicates that AECOM may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. While a ratio above 1 suggests the company can cover its current liabilities, a higher value would provide greater financial security.

Next, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.3443 reveals that AECOM relies heavily on debt to finance its operations. A higher ratio indicates a higher financial risk, as the company may struggle to repay its long-term debts.

Furthermore, the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5657 suggests that AECOM has a moderate level of debt compared to its equity. Although this ratio is below 1, indicating that the company has more equity than debt, it still implies a certain level of financial risk.

The gross margin, operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin all demonstrate relatively low profitability. These margins indicate that AECOM's profits are modest compared to its revenue and operating expenses. A higher margin would reflect stronger financial performance.

Additionally, the return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) ratios provide insights into AECOM's profitability in relation to shareholders' investment. With an ROE of 11.7254 and an ROTE of 135.7189, the company's ability to generate returns for its shareholders is considered below average.

Moreover, the asset turnover ratio of 1.4391 indicates that AECOM's assets are not efficiently utilized to generate revenue. A higher value would suggest that the company is more effective at generating revenue from its assets.

Lastly, the operating cash flow per share and free cash flow per share indicate AECOM's ability to generate cash from its operations and the amount of cash available for investment. Although positive, these values are relatively low, implying limited financial flexibility.

In summary, AECOM's poor credit rating is primarily due to its low profitability, heavy reliance on debt, and limited ability to generate cash. These factors indicate financial weakness and may affect the company's ability to meet its financial obligations and support its growth and investment plans."

The company's binary rating of 1 indicates a positive assessment of its creditworthiness. AEP's current ratio of 0.7052 suggests that it has sufficient current assets to cover its short-term liabilities, reflecting a healthy liquidity position.

Furthermore, AEP's long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.5113 signifies that the company relies moderately on debt financing, indicating a balanced capital structure. The debt/equity ratio of 1.1895 also supports this notion, as it shows that AEP has a reasonable level of debt compared to its equity.

AEP's gross margin of 62.4728 and operating margin of 19.0536 indicate that the company is able to generate profits from its operations. The EBITDA margin of 31.4956 shows that AEP has a good level of profitability before accounting for taxes, interest, and depreciation.

In terms of cash flow, AEP has a positive operating cash flow per share of 0.5685, indicating that the company is able to generate cash from its core operations. However, the negative free cash flow per share of -0.5298 suggests that AEP may be investing heavily in its growth and expansion.

This conclusion is drawn from several key factors.

Firstly, the current ratio of 2.2042 indicates that the company's current assets are only slightly more than twice its current liabilities. While this suggests that the company is able to meet its short-term obligations, it also indicates a relatively weak liquidity position.

Secondly, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.1906 and the debt to equity ratio of 0.2355 indicate that Darling Ingredients Inc. has a moderate level of debt in relation to its capital structure. Although these ratios are not excessively high, they still suggest a potential financial risk.

Furthermore, the gross margin of 26.4492 and the net profit margin of 7.3775 indicate relatively low profitability. This implies that the company may be facing challenges in generating sufficient revenue and controlling costs.

Additionally, the return on equity (ROE) of 12.3085 and the return on assets (ROA) of 8.4236 indicate relatively low returns for investors and shareholders. These figures suggest that the company's profitability and efficiency in utilizing its assets are below average.

Overall, the combination of these indicators paints a picture of a company with weak liquidity, moderate debt levels, and relatively low profitability and returns. These factors contribute to the overall poor credit status of Darling Ingredients Inc. It is important for investors and lenders to consider these factors when assessing the financial health and creditworthiness of the company."

This rating suggests that the company may face difficulties in meeting its financial obligations and poses a higher level of risk to potential investors or creditors.

The company's current ratio of 0.7198 indicates that it may struggle to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets. Additionally, the debt/equity ratio of 1.2209 suggests that Range Resources Corporation relies heavily on debt financing, which increases its financial risk. This is further supported by the long-term debt/capital ratio of 0.5497.

While the company's gross margin of 93.8094 indicates a high profitability on its sales, the operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, and pre-tax profit margin, all estimated at 22.6517, suggest that Range Resources Corporation may face challenges in effectively managing its operating expenses.

Furthermore, the return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 0.5515 indicate that the company's profitability in relation to the shareholders' investment is relatively low. The return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI) of 0.1932 and 0.2483, respectively, also suggest that the company's overall efficiency and profitability may be subpar.

Lastly, the negative free cash flow per share of -1.4781 indicates that Range Resources Corporation is generating less cash than it is spending, which can further strain its financial position.

In summary, Range Resources Corporation's overall credit status is considered poor, as evidenced by its low current ratio, high debt levels, lower profitability margins, and negative free cash flow. These factors indicate the company's vulnerability to financial risks and its limited ability to meet its financial obligations."

The company's binary rating of 0 indicates a negative credit outlook. Furthermore, the financial ratios highlight several concerning aspects of the company's creditworthiness.

The current ratio of 1.3023 suggests that HCA Healthcare may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. A ratio below 2 is generally considered less favorable, indicating potential liquidity issues. Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 1.3765 indicates a high level of debt in relation to the company's capital structure. This may suggest financial risk and reduced flexibility in managing its debt obligations.

The debt/equity ratio of -3.8569 is unusual and suggests a significant imbalance between debt and equity. Negative values in this ratio are atypical, and it implies that the company's debt outweighs its equity, which can be a cause for concern.

Despite a relatively high gross margin of 82.5517, the operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin of 15.4841, 15.4841, and 20.6556 respectively indicate that HCA Healthcare's profitability is relatively low. These margins reflect the company's ability to generate profits from its operations, and lower margins may signify challenges in managing costs and expenses.

Moreover, the return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) are negative at -40.519 and -23.1716 respectively. These figures indicate that the company's shareholders are generating negative returns on their investments, suggesting poor performance and inefficiencies in capital utilization.

Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.2012 indicates that Marathon Oil Corporation has a significant amount of debt compared to its capital structure. This suggests a higher level of financial risk as the company may struggle to repay its long-term obligations.

Furthermore, the debt/equity ratio of 0.3027 implies that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which increases its financial leverage. This could pose challenges in the future, especially if interest rates rise or if the company experiences a decline in profitability.

While the company's gross margin of 59.8838 indicates a healthy level of profitability, the operating margin, EBIT margin, and pre-tax profit margin of 14.7428, suggest that Marathon Oil Corporation has relatively low profitability compared to its competitors. This could be a result of various factors such as increased costs or declining revenues.

In terms of efficiency, the asset turnover ratio of 0.3014 indicates that the company is not generating a substantial amount of revenue per unit of assets. This could suggest inefficiencies in the utilization of assets.

The debt to equity ratio of 2.9223 indicates that Tenet Healthcare Corp. has a high level of debt relative to its equity, which can be seen as a risk factor and may make it more vulnerable to financial distress. Furthermore, the company's gross margin of 35.7176 is relatively low, indicating that it has limited profitability after deducting the cost of goods sold.

While the operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin all stand at 7.5456 and the pre-tax profit margin is 1.8951, these figures suggest that the company is not generating substantial profits from its operations. The net profit margin of 0.6702 further supports this notion.

Tenet Healthcare Corp.'s return on equity (ROE) of 8.8946 and return on tangible equity of 38.5768 demonstrate that the company is not effectively utilizing its equity to generate profits. The return on assets (ROA) of 1.2172 and return on investment (ROI) of 1.7802 also indicate relatively low profitability.

The company's asset turnover of 1.0227 suggests that it is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate sales. Lastly, the operating cash flow per share of 0.7298 and free cash flow per share of 0.2099 indicate a limited ability to generate cash from its operations.

In summary, Tenet Healthcare Corp. exhibits a poor credit status based on its weak liquidity position, high debt levels, low profitability, and inefficient use of assets. These factors may pose challenges to the company's financial stability and ability to meet its financial obligations."

With an asset turnover of 3.3237, McKesson demonstrates effective utilization of its assets to generate revenue. This efficiency is also reflected in the return on equity (ROE) of 22.7829, indicating that the company is generating a healthy return for its shareholders. 

However, it is worth noting that the return on tangible equity (ROTE) is negative at -35.608, which suggests that the company's intangible assets are contributing significantly to its overall equity. 

Overall, McKesson Corporation appears to have a solid credit status, with consistent profitability, healthy liquidity, and efficient asset utilization. However, the negative ROTE should be further examined to understand the impact of intangible assets on the company's financial position."

The company's current ratio of 1.1099 indicates that it has enough short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities, but it is relatively low compared to industry standards. 

The long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.9361 suggests that a significant portion of the company's capital structure is comprised of debt. With a debt/equity ratio of 14.7987, it is evident that Tenet Healthcare Corporation heavily relies on debt financing, which increases its financial risk.

The gross margin of 35.8369 shows the company's ability to generate profits from its revenue, while the operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin indicate the profitability of its operations. However, these margins are relatively low, suggesting that the company's profitability is under pressure.

Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4633 indicates a relatively high level of debt, posing a risk to the company's financial stability.

The debt/equity ratio of 0.8735 further supports the notion of a poor credit status, as it signifies that the company relies heavily on debt financing compared to equity. The gross margin of 15.8873 and operating margin of 10.2818 reflect the profitability of the company's operations, but they are not strong enough to compensate for the high debt burden.

The debt/equity ratio of 2.733 further highlights the company's reliance on borrowing. A high debt/equity ratio indicates that the company has a higher proportion of debt compared to equity, which can result in higher interest payments and reduced financial flexibility.

The gross margin of 16.9097 indicates that the company has a low profitability margin on its sales. This may be due to high costs of goods sold or pricing pressures in the industry. The operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, and pre-tax profit margin all hover around 3%, suggesting that the company's profitability is relatively low.

The net profit margin of 1.6395 indicates that the company's ability to generate profits from its sales is limited.

The company's current ratio of 1.2684 suggests that it may have difficulties meeting its short-term obligations. Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of -1.381 indicates an imbalance in the company's capital structure, potentially exposing it to financial risks.

The negative values for both the debt/equity ratio (-0.6447) and the gross margin (13.6681) further emphasize the company's weak credit position. These figures imply that Eastman Kodak Co. has a negative equity and is experiencing challenges in generating profits from its sales.

Furthermore, the negative operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin all indicate that the company is operating at a loss. This is a significant concern as it suggests that Eastman Kodak Co. is not effectively managing its costs and expenses, resulting in a negative bottom line.

The asset turnover ratio of 0.7664 implies that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate sales. Moreover, the negative return on assets (-15.7974) indicates that Eastman Kodak Co. is not generating a satisfactory return on its investments.

Despite these challenges, the return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) figures of 31.4468 and 28.131, respectively, suggest that the company is still able to generate positive returns for its shareholders. However, it is important to note that these figures may be misleading due to the overall poor performance of the company.

The company's financial indicators reveal a weak profitability, inefficient asset utilization, and an imbalance in its capital structure. These factors highlight the need for the company to address its financial challenges and improve its creditworthiness."

The company's binary rating of 0 indicates a negative credit assessment. 

Looking at the liquidity position, Rite Aid has a current ratio of 3.6053, suggesting that it has sufficient current assets to cover its short-term liabilities. However, this alone does not guarantee a healthy credit status. 

The long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.1661 indicates that Rite Aid relies heavily on equity financing rather than debt, which is generally considered favorable. Additionally, the debt/equity ratio of 0.2 further supports the company's low reliance on debt. 

Moving on to profitability, Rite Aid's gross margin of 55.2577 is relatively high, indicating that the company is able to generate a reasonable profit from its sales. However, the operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, and pre-tax profit margin are all at 7.9456, which is quite low. This suggests that Rite Aid faces challenges in controlling its operating expenses and maximizing its profitability.

Furthermore, the net profit margin is 3.6475, indicating that Rite Aid's overall profitability is limited. The return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) ratios are also low at 3.5583 and 5.547, respectively. These ratios indicate that Rite Aid is not efficiently utilizing its shareholders' equity to generate returns.

The return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI) ratios stand at 2.2961 and 2.9672, respectively. These figures suggest that Rite Aid is not maximizing its assets and investments to generate significant returns.

In terms of cash flow, the company has negative operating cash flow per share and free cash flow per share, indicating that Rite Aid is not generating sufficient cash from its operations and has limited free cash flow for potential investments or debt repayment.

The company's current ratio of 2.4659 suggests that it has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities, indicating a relatively healthy liquidity position. However, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.1168 indicates that a significant portion of the company's capital structure is financed through debt. 

The debt/equity ratio of 0.1519 further highlights the company's reliance on debt financing, which may raise concerns about its ability to meet its financial obligations in the long run. The gross margin of 24.9985 indicates that the company generates a reasonable profit after accounting for the cost of goods sold. 

However, the operating margin, EBIT margin, and pre-tax profit margin, all at 10.9709, suggest that the company's profitability is relatively low. The net profit margin of 7.3108 further supports this notion. 

The return on equity (ROE) of 14.0356 indicates that the company generates a 14.0356% return on its shareholders' equity. This is a moderate return, but the return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 22.7189 suggests that the company is able to generate a higher return on its tangible assets. 

The return on assets (ROA) of 8.2982 indicates that the company's assets are generating an 8.2982% return. The return on investment (ROI) of 12.3958 suggests that the company is able to generate a 12.3958% return on its total investment. 

The operating cash flow per share of 0.8762 indicates that the company generates a positive cash flow from its operations. The free cash flow per share of 0.7363 suggests that the company has some cash left after meeting its capital expenditure requirements. 

In summary, while EnerSys has a healthy liquidity position and generates reasonable profit margins, its heavy reliance on debt financing and relatively low profitability may contribute to its ""Poor credit"" rating. The company's ability to generate returns on equity and tangible equity, as well as positive cash flows, provide some positive indicators, but overall, caution is warranted when assessing the credit status of EnerSys."

However, the return on assets (ROA) is negative at -15.7974%, indicating that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate profits. 

Additionally, the return on investment (ROI) of 74.8734% indicates that the company is generating a positive return on the funds invested. However, the negative values for operating cash flow per share and free cash flow per share (-2.9934 and -2.9329, respectively) highlight the company's cash flow difficulties.

The company's current ratio of 3.4041 indicates that it has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities. However, its long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.2238 suggests that the company relies heavily on borrowed funds to finance its operations.

The debt/equity ratio of 0.2884 further supports the notion of high leverage, indicating that Vishay Intertechnology Inc. has a significant amount of debt relative to its equity. This can be a cause for concern as it increases the company's financial risk.

Although the gross margin of 29.6315 and operating margin of 15.3367 appear to be somewhat healthy, the pre-tax profit margin of 14.8814 and net profit margin of 13.1778 suggest that the company's profitability is not strong. Furthermore, the return on equity (ROE) of 24.0653 and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 26.0455 indicate that Vishay Intertechnology Inc. is not generating significant returns for its shareholders.

Additionally, the asset turnover of 0.9187 implies that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate sales. The lower-than-average ROA (return on assets) of 12.1471 and ROI (return on investment) of 18.6793 further support this notion.

The operating cash flow per share of 1.3101 and free cash flow per share of 0.7874 indicate that the company's cash generation is limited, which may hinder its ability to invest in growth opportunities or repay its debts.

In summary, Vishay Intertechnology Inc.'s overall credit status appears to be poor. The company's heavy reliance on debt, lower profitability, inefficient asset utilization, and limited cash generation contribute to this assessment."

However, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.6754 and the debt/equity ratio of 2.0898 suggest that the company has a significant amount of debt in relation to its capital and equity. This indicates a higher level of financial risk and potential difficulty in meeting long-term obligations.

Furthermore, the company's gross margin of 31.9301 and operating margin of 7.1718 are relatively low, indicating lower profitability. The pre-tax profit margin of 1.1229 and net profit margin of 0.1611 further highlight the company's struggle to generate significant profits. Additionally, the return on equity (ROE) of 0.4528 and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of -0.2862 reflect the company's inefficiency in generating returns for its shareholders.

While the asset turnover of 0.693 indicates that the company is utilizing its assets to generate revenue, the overall picture suggests that CommScope Holding Company, Inc. is facing financial challenges. The company's poor credit rating can also be attributed to its limited operating cash flow per share of 0.9915 and free cash flow per share of 1.0046, which indicate a potential inability to generate sufficient cash to meet its financial obligations.

In summary, CommScope Holding Company, Inc. is experiencing financial difficulties and has a poor credit status.

The return on equity (ROE) of 7.5884% indicates that the company generates a satisfactory return for its shareholders.

The return on assets (ROA) of 4.0143% and return on investment (ROI) of 4.8532% demonstrate that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. efficiently utilizes its assets and investments to generate profits.

Finally, the negative operating cash flow per share of -0.0666 suggests that the company generates more cash outflow from its operations than inflow. However, the positive free cash flow per share of 0.0426 indicates that the company has sufficient cash flow after accounting for capital expenditures.

Overall, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. exhibits a good credit status, reflecting its strong liquidity, profitability, and efficient asset utilization. However, the negative return on tangible equity and negative operating cash flow should be closely monitored."

Furthermore, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 1.8638 indicates that the company has a relatively high level of debt compared to its capital, which may increase its financial risk. The negative debt/equity ratio of -2.1577 is unusual and suggests that the company has negative equity, meaning that its liabilities exceed its assets. This further highlights the company's financial instability.

The gross margin of 17.5953 and operating margin of 8.94 indicate that the company's profitability is relatively low.

This assessment is primarily derived from the binary rating of 0, which indicates a negative credit outlook. 

The company's current ratio of 1.6958 suggests that it may have some difficulties in meeting its short-term obligations. A higher current ratio is generally desirable as it signifies a better ability to cover short-term liabilities. Moreover, the debt/equity ratio of 1.1695 indicates a relatively high level of leverage, which raises concerns about the company's financial stability and ability to manage its debt.

Additionally, the return on tangible equity (ROTE) of -54.0508 is significantly negative, indicating that the company is not generating returns from its tangible assets. This is a worrisome sign as it indicates inefficiency in utilizing the company's resources to generate profits.

Furthermore, the low asset turnover of 0.3733 suggests that Constellation Brands is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate sales. This could be due to various factors such as poor inventory management or underutilization of production facilities.

Although the company does have positive profitability margins, with gross margin, operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin all above 15%, these margins alone do not compensate for the underlying issues highlighted by the other financial indicators.

In conclusion, Constellation Brands, Inc. exhibits a poor credit status based on its current ratio, debt/equity ratio, return on tangible equity, and asset turnover. These indicators collectively suggest that the company faces challenges in meeting its short-term obligations, managing its debt, generating returns from tangible assets, and efficiently utilizing its resources.

Several key factors contribute to this assessment. Firstly, the current ratio of 1.362 indicates that the company's current assets may not be sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. This could pose liquidity challenges and hinder the company's ability to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner.

Moreover, the debt-related ratios paint a concerning picture. The long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.3981 and the debt/equity ratio of 0.7681 indicate that the company relies heavily on borrowed funds. This high level of debt might indicate increased financial risk and potential difficulties in servicing its debt obligations.

The profitability margins of the company also contribute to its poor credit rating. While the gross margin of 26.6227 suggests a reasonable level of profitability, the operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin all indicate relatively low profitability. These margins reflect the company's ability to generate profits from its operations, and their low values suggest a less favorable credit outlook.

Furthermore, the return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) ratios of 19.7282 and 23.9984, respectively, indicate that the company's shareholders may not be earning a significant return on their investments. Similarly, the return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI) ratios of 8.1983 and 11.8749, respectively, suggest that the company's overall efficiency in utilizing its assets and investments is relatively low.

In conclusion, based on the provided financial indicators, AAR CORP. has been assigned a ""Poor credit"" rating due to its low profitability, high debt levels, and potential liquidity challenges. These factors collectively suggest that the company may face difficulties in meeting its financial obligations and may pose a higher risk to creditors."

The current ratio of Constellation Brands, Inc. stands at 2.5743, indicating that the company has a relatively good ability to meet its short-term obligations. However, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.5465 and the debt to equity ratio of 1.2406 suggest that the company heavily relies on debt to finance its operations. This high level of debt can pose a risk to the company's financial stability and could potentially hinder its ability to generate positive cash flows in the long run.

Furthermore, the profitability margins of Constellation Brands, Inc. are also a cause for concern. The gross margin of 42.777% indicates that the company has a relatively high cost of goods sold, which could negatively impact its overall profitability. Additionally, the operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin all suggest that the company's profitability is relatively low. This could be due to factors such as high operating expenses or low sales volumes.

In terms of asset turnover, Constellation Brands, Inc. has a ratio of 0.3994, indicating that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate revenue. This could be a result of factors such as underutilized production capacity or ineffective marketing strategies.

Overall, the poor credit status of Constellation Brands, Inc. is reflected in its high levels of debt, low profitability margins, and inefficient asset turnover. These factors indicate that the company may face challenges in meeting its financial obligations and generating sustainable profits in the long term."

Several factors contribute to this assessment.

Firstly, the current ratio of 1.3204 indicates that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations. A current ratio below 2 is generally considered weak, suggesting potential liquidity issues.

Secondly, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.3799 and the debt to equity ratio of 0.6336 highlight a significant reliance on debt financing. This indicates a higher risk profile, as the company's ability to generate profits and repay its debts may be compromised.

The company's binary rating of 0, along with negative profit margins and low return on equity, indicates a weak financial performance.

Tata Motors Limited's current ratio of 2.0699 suggests that it has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities. However, the company's long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.412 indicates a relatively high level of debt in its capital structure. This raises concerns about the company's ability to meet its long-term financial obligations.

The debt/equity ratio of 0.7406 further highlights the company's reliance on debt financing. A higher ratio suggests a greater financial risk, as a significant portion of the company's funding comes from creditors. This can lead to increased interest payments and potential difficulties in repaying the debt.

The negative operating margin and pre-tax profit margin of -10.5302 and -12.4843, respectively, indicate that Tata Motors Limited is currently experiencing losses in its operations. This could be attributed to factors such as high operating expenses or declining sales.

Additionally, the negative return on equity, return on tangible equity, return on assets, and return on investment further emphasize the weak financial performance of the company. These metrics indicate that Tata Motors Limited is not generating sufficient profits from its investments and operations.

In conclusion, Tata Motors Limited is facing a poor credit status due to its high level of debt, negative profit margins, and low returns on equity and investments. The company needs to address these financial challenges to improve its creditworthiness and ensure long-term sustainability."

The debt/equity ratio of 0.2073 indicates that TMS International Corporation has a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. This implies that the company relies more on equity financing rather than debt financing, which is generally viewed as a positive factor.

On the profitability side, TMS International Corporation faces significant challenges. The gross margin of 41.8033 reflects a relatively high cost of goods sold compared to its revenue, which could be a cause for concern.

The company exhibits several concerning ratios and margins, indicating potential financial instability.

Firstly, the current ratio of 1.8164 suggests that the company may have difficulties meeting its short-term obligations. A ratio below 2 is typically considered weak and raises concerns about liquidity.

The long-term debt to capital ratio of 1.1508 indicates that the company relies heavily on debt to finance its operations. This high level of debt can pose risks, especially if the company faces financial difficulties or economic downturns.

The debt/equity ratio of -7.9655 is abnormally negative, suggesting that the company has negative equity. This is a worrisome sign as it implies that the company's liabilities outweigh its assets. Negative equity can signal financial distress and hinder the company's ability to raise additional funds.

Furthermore, the negative return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of -76.12% and -10.1581% respectively indicate that the company is not generating sufficient profits relative to the shareholders' investments.

The company's binary rating of 0 indicates a negative credit assessment. 

Examining the company's liquidity position, the current ratio of 3.1396 suggests that Central Garden & Pet Co. may have enough short-term assets to cover its current liabilities. However, this alone does not guarantee a favorable credit status. 

Looking at the company's debt-related ratios, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.488 indicates a moderate level of debt in relation to its capital structure. The debt/equity ratio of 0.9536 suggests that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which can be perceived as a higher credit risk. 

Analyzing profitability, the gross margin of 30.3269 indicates that the company is able to generate a decent profit margin on its sales. However, the operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin are all relatively low, ranging from 1.739 to 5.2298. This implies that the company's profitability is not strong, which contributes to its poor credit status. 

Additionally, the return on equity (ROE), return on tangible equity, return on assets (ROA), and return on investment (ROI) are also relatively low, suggesting that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets and investments to generate returns for shareholders.

Firstly, Vishay Intertechnology Inc. exhibits a high debt-to-equity ratio of 0.2482, indicating a significant reliance on borrowed funds. Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.1988 suggests that a considerable portion of the company's capital structure is comprised of long-term debt.

The company's current ratio of 4.6856 indicates that it has a strong ability to meet its short-term obligations. However, its long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4929 suggests that it relies heavily on debt financing, which may increase its financial risk.

The debt to equity ratio of 0.979 further highlights the company's significant reliance on debt. This could potentially strain its financial position and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns or changes in interest rates.

Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Ltd has a high gross margin of 89.9889, indicating that it has a strong ability to generate profits from its sales. However, its operating, EBIT, and EBITDA margins of 16.6759 and 29.2438 respectively indicate that the company's profitability is relatively low compared to its expenses.

The company's current ratio of 1.3023 indicates that it may have difficulty covering short-term obligations with its current assets. Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 1.3765 suggests that the company relies heavily on debt to finance its operations.

The debt/equity ratio of -3.8569 is concerning as it implies that the company has negative equity, indicating a risky financial position. This is further supported by the negative return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) ratios, which stand at -40.519 and -23.1716 respectively. These ratios indicate that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its shareholders' investments.

Although the gross margin of 82.5517 is relatively high, the operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, and pre-tax profit margin all stand at 15.4841, suggesting limited profitability. The net profit margin of 8.3047 indicates that the company's bottom line is also relatively low.

On a positive note, HCA Healthcare Inc. demonstrates a decent asset turnover ratio of 1.1035, indicating efficient utilization of its assets to generate revenue. The return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI) ratios of 10.5658 and 15.2542 respectively, suggest that the company is generating reasonable returns on its assets and investments.

However, the poor credit rating overall is primarily driven by the company's high reliance on debt, negative equity, and limited profitability.

This is further supported by the negative pre-tax profit margin of -7.1153, indicating that the company is operating at a loss before taxes.

Despite these challenges, NRG Energy does show some positive indicators. The net profit margin of 2.0707 suggests that the company is able to generate some profit after all expenses are accounted for. Similarly, the return on equity (ROE) of 2.5688 and return on tangible equity of 4.2705 indicate that the company is able to generate a modest return on its shareholders' investment.

However, NRG Energy's overall credit status remains poor due to its low profitability margins, high debt levels, and potential liquidity concerns indicated by its current ratio. The company's negative operating cash flow per share and negative free cash flow per share further emphasize the financial challenges it faces.

In conclusion, NRG Energy, Inc. faces significant financial difficulties, resulting in a poor credit rating. The company must address its high debt levels, improve its profitability margins, and generate positive cash flow to enhance its creditworthiness and financial stability."

Several key ratios and margins point to potential financial difficulties for the company. 

The current ratio of 1.4112 suggests that HCA Healthcare may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations, as the ideal current ratio is generally considered to be above 2. Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 1.3353 indicates that the company has a significant amount of debt in relation to its capital base, which could be a cause for concern.

The debt/equity ratio of -4.0958 indicates an unhealthy financial position, possibly due to a negative equity value. This suggests that the company may have more debt than assets, putting it at risk of insolvency.

Furthermore, the negative return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of -28.8106 and -15.5561, respectively, highlight the company's poor profitability and inefficiency in generating returns for shareholders.

Despite these negative indicators, HCA Healthcare does show some positive aspects. The gross margin of 82.5347 and EBITDA margin of 19.3933 suggest that the company is able to generate a decent profit on its operations. However, these margins are not sufficient to overcome the poor credit status indicated by the other financial indicators.

Overall, considering the low current ratio, high debt levels, negative ROE and ROTE, it can be concluded that HCA Healthcare, Inc. has a poor credit status. The company's profitability and ability to generate returns for shareholders are significantly hindered by its financial difficulties."

The company's binary rating of 0 indicates a low creditworthiness. Several financial ratios further support this assessment.

Although it has some liquidity, it may not be sufficient to cover its liabilities if they were to become due immediately. Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.3585 indicates that the company relies relatively heavily on debt financing, which can be a risk factor.

The debt/equity ratio of 0.5589 implies that the company has a moderate level of debt compared to its equity. While this ratio is not alarmingly high, it still indicates a significant level of financial leverage. A higher debt/equity ratio can increase the financial risk for the company and its investors.

The profitability margins of Kosmos Energy, Ltd. are also below average. The gross margin of 78.0636 suggests that the company has a high cost of goods sold relative to its revenue. The operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin of 38.9746 and 62.6088, respectively, indicate that the company's profitability from its core operations is relatively low.

Moreover, the net profit margin of 31.6481 reveals that the company's ability to generate profits after all expenses, including taxes and interest, is relatively modest. This could be attributed to various factors, such as higher operating costs or lower revenue.

Furthermore, the return on equity (ROE), return on tangible equity, return on assets (ROA), and return on investment (ROI) all indicate below-average performance. These metrics suggest that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets and capital to generate profits.

Overall, based on the provided financial indicators, the credit status of Kosmos Energy, Ltd. is poor. The company faces challenges in terms of liquidity, debt management, profitability, and return on investment."

Several key factors contribute to this assessment.

Firstly, the current ratio, which measures a company's ability to cover its short-term obligations, stands at 1.9543. While this indicates that the company has sufficient current assets to meet its current liabilities, it falls below the ideal ratio of 2. A lower current ratio suggests a potential liquidity risk.

Secondly, the debt-related ratios also raise concerns. With a long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.366 and a debt/equity ratio of 0.5864, Peabody Energy Corporation has a significant portion of its capital structure financed by debt. This exposes the company to higher financial risk, making it more vulnerable to economic downturns or changes in interest rates.

Furthermore, the profitability margins also indicate a weak credit status. The gross margin, operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, and pre-tax profit margin all hover around 20-30%. While not extremely low, these margins suggest that Peabody Energy Corporation faces challenges in generating substantial profits from its operations.

Additionally, the return on equity (ROE), return on tangible equity, return on assets (ROA), and return on investment (ROI) are all below ideal levels. This indicates that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets and capital to generate returns for its shareholders.

Lastly, the negative free cash flow per share raises concerns about the company's ability to generate sufficient cash to fund its operations and meet its financial obligations.

In summary, Peabody Energy Corporation's credit status is poor due to its low current ratio, high debt levels, modest profitability margins, and below-average returns on equity and assets. These indicators suggest potential financial challenges and a higher risk profile for the company."

The debt/equity ratio of 1.0077 further supports the company's favorable credit status, as it indicates that Southwest Gas Corp. has a balanced mix of debt and equity in its capital structure. The gross margin of 75.1215% reflects the profitability of the company's operations, with a significant portion of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold.

The current ratio of 1.5134 indicates that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its short-term liabilities, suggesting a healthy liquidity position. Moreover, the debt/equity ratio of 0.3832 shows that eBay relies more on equity financing rather than debt, indicating a lower risk of financial distress.

The high gross margin of 81.0808% implies that eBay has a strong pricing strategy and effective cost management, resulting in a significant profit from each sale. The operating margin, EBIT margin, and pre-tax profit margin all around 28% indicate that the company is efficient in generating profits from its operations. Additionally, the EBITDA margin of 35.9272% suggests that eBay's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are also healthy.

However, the net profit margin of 0.5233% is relatively low, indicating that eBay's bottom line is affected by other expenses such as taxes and interest payments. The negative return on equity (ROE), return on tangible equity (ROTE), return on assets (ROA), and return on investment (ROI) values reveal that the company is currently not generating positive returns for its shareholders or investors.

Despite the negative returns, eBay's operating cash flow per share and free cash flow per share are positive, showing that the company is generating cash from its operations and has the potential for future investments or dividend distributions.

In conclusion, eBay Inc. demonstrates good credit worthiness based on its strong liquidity position, efficient operations, and positive cash flows. However, the negative returns on equity and other investment indicators indicate room for improvement in terms of profitability."

The corporation exhibits a good credit rating, indicating a strong financial position and ability to meet its financial obligations.

The current ratio of 0.8254 suggests that Sempra Energy may have some short-term liquidity concerns, as the ratio is below the ideal value of 1. However, this is offset by the corporation's low long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4997, indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its capital structure. Furthermore, the debt/equity ratio of 1.1808 suggests that the company relies more on equity financing than debt. These factors contribute to the overall positive credit status of the enterprise.

The company's current ratio of 1.4647 indicates that it may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations, as a ratio below 2 is generally considered weak. Additionally, its high long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.5235 suggests a heavy reliance on debt financing, which can increase financial risk.

The debt/equity ratio of 1.11 further supports this notion, as it indicates that the company has more debt than equity, potentially leading to higher interest expenses and reduced profitability. The gross margin of 47.6643 highlights the company's ability to generate revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold, but it is not sufficient to offset the concerns raised by other indicators.

Operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin all provide insight into the company's profitability, with values of 24.307, 24.307, and 33.5301 respectively. While these margins indicate a certain level of profitability, they do not compensate for the company's poor liquidity and high debt levels.

The net profit margin of 16.8207 reveals that the company is not generating significant profits after accounting for all expenses, further confirming its poor credit status. The low asset turnover of 0.5602 suggests that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate revenue.

The return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) ratios of 28.344 and 28.5851 respectively indicate that the company is generating decent returns for its shareholders, but these figures alone are not enough to improve its overall credit status.

In conclusion, Las Vegas Sands, LLC's poor credit rating is primarily due to its weak liquidity position, high debt levels, and low asset turnover. While the company may be generating some profits, it is not enough to offset its financial risks and overall poor credit status."

The binary rating of 0 further confirms the poor credit status of Telefonica SA. This rating suggests that the company is at a high risk of defaulting on its financial obligations. The negative return on tangible equity (-22.205) also indicates that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its investments.

Furthermore, the low operating cash flow per share (-0.6709) and free cash flow per share (-0.6656) reflect the company's inability to generate positive cash flow from its operations. This raises doubts about its ability to invest in future growth opportunities or even service its existing debt.

Several key ratios and margins contribute to this assessment.

The company's current ratio of 2.0037 indicates that it has a relatively healthy short-term liquidity position, with enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. However, this alone does not determine the overall credit status.

The long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4459 suggests that the company relies significantly on debt financing. This could increase its financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns or interest rate hikes.

The debt/equity ratio of 0.8054 further supports the high level of debt in the company's capital structure. It indicates that a significant portion of the company's assets is financed by debt rather than equity.

The gross margin of 8.7435 indicates that the company has a relatively low profitability on its sales, which could be due to factors such as high production costs or intense competition.

The operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin all hover around 4%, indicating that the company's profitability from its core operations is relatively low.

The pre-tax profit margin and net profit margin both stand at around 1.4%, further reinforcing the company's low levels of profitability.

This suggests that ConocoPhillips is currently experiencing some financial challenges, possibly due to industry-specific factors such as low oil prices.

The company's asset turnover ratio of 0.3173 indicates that ConocoPhillips is not utilizing its assets efficiently to generate revenue. Additionally, negative return on equity, return on tangible equity, return on assets, and return on investment further highlight the challenging financial situation of the company.

Furthermore, the negative operating cash flow per share and free cash flow per share indicate that the company is not generating sufficient cash flow from its operations and has limited cash available after making necessary investments. This may further restrict the company's ability to meet its financial obligations.

In conclusion, while ConocoPhillips has a low level of debt and healthy gross margin, its negative profit margins, low asset turnover, and negative returns on equity and assets suggest financial challenges. The company's liquidity position is also a concern. It is crucial for ConocoPhillips to address these issues and improve its financial performance to maintain its ""Good credit"" rating."

This could increase the company's financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns.

The debt/equity ratio of 1.2614 further supports the notion that Oasis Petroleum Inc. has a poor credit status. A high debt/equity ratio indicates that the company has a significant amount of debt in relation to its equity, which can be a cause for concern for potential lenders and investors.

This implies that the company is able to generate a reasonable amount of profit from its operations. However, the margins are not exceptional, which could contribute to the poor credit rating.

The asset turnover ratio of 0.1913 indicates that Oasis Petroleum Inc. is not utilizing its assets efficiently to generate revenue. This could be due to various reasons such as underutilization of assets or inefficiencies in operations.

The return on equity (ROE), return on tangible equity, return on assets (ROA), and return on investment (ROI) are all below average, indicating that the company is not generating substantial returns for its shareholders and investors.

Furthermore, the negative free cash flow per share suggests that the company is not generating enough cash to cover its operating expenses and capital expenditures, which is another negative factor contributing to its poor credit rating.

The company's binary rating is 0, indicating a negative credit assessment. This suggests that the company may have a higher risk of defaulting on its financial obligations.

Several key ratios further support this assessment. The current ratio, which measures the company's ability to meet short-term obligations, is 2.1327. While this indicates a relatively healthy liquidity position, it does not compensate for other concerning indicators. The long-term debt to capital ratio is 0.4111, suggesting that a significant portion of the company's capital structure is funded by debt. Additionally, the debt to equity ratio stands at 0.9286, indicating that the company has a relatively high level of debt compared to its equity.

Profitability ratios also paint a challenging picture. The gross margin is 16.1555, indicating that the company's profitability from sales is relatively low. Furthermore, the net profit margin stands at 5.8896, highlighting the company's limited ability to generate profits from its operations.

The return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) ratios are 16.7053 and 6.1768, respectively. These figures suggest that the company is not effectively utilizing its shareholders' equity or assets to generate returns. The return on investment (ROI) ratio is 9.8378, indicating that the company's investments are not generating significant returns.

Overall, the combination of high debt levels, low profitability, and subpar returns on equity and assets contribute to the poor credit status of Titan International Inc.

This conclusion is primarily based on the binary rating of 0, indicating a negative credit assessment. 

Examining the company's liquidity, the current ratio of 1.3014 suggests that it may have sufficient short-term assets to cover its immediate liabilities. However, when considering long-term debt in relation to capital, with a ratio of 0.2096, it indicates a relatively high level of long-term debt compared to the company's overall capital structure. The debt/equity ratio of 0.2682 further supports this, revealing a significant reliance on borrowed funds.

In terms of profitability, Hess Corporation demonstrates relatively healthy margins. The gross margin of 83.9899% suggests the company has a strong control over its production costs. However, the operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin, all at 19.1581%, indicate that the company's operating income is limited.

The debt/equity ratio of 1.2198 implies that the company's level of debt is higher than its equity, indicating a relatively higher financial risk.

In terms of profitability, Plains All American Pipeline demonstrates moderate margins. The gross margin of 5.7703 indicates that the company generates a reasonable profit after accounting for the cost of goods sold. The operating margin, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin all hover around 4% to 5%, suggesting that the company is able to generate a decent return on its operations. 

The asset turnover ratio of 1.958 indicates that the company efficiently utilizes its assets to generate sales. The return on equity (ROE) stands at 16.921%, reflecting the company's ability to generate profits from shareholders' investments. The return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 24.2054% suggests that the company's tangible assets also contribute positively to profitability. The return on assets (ROA) of 6.2438% demonstrates the company's ability to generate profits from its total assets. Finally, the return on investment (ROI) of 8.2036% indicates that the company yields a positive return on its investments.

Overall, Plains All American Pipeline exhibits a favorable credit status with moderate profitability and efficient utilization of assets. However, the company's reliance on debt and relatively low liquidity may warrant further attention to ensure stable financial performance."

The return on equity, return on tangible equity, return on assets, and return on investment all fall below 6%, indicating suboptimal returns for shareholders and investors.

Furthermore, the operating cash flow per share and free cash flow per share are relatively low at 1.6388 and 1.6163, respectively, suggesting limited cash flow generation and potential challenges in funding future operations and investments.

In summary, M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. faces significant credit challenges due to its high reliance on debt, low profitability margins, inefficient asset utilization, and suboptimal returns on equity and investment. These factors collectively contribute to the company's poor credit rating."

The debt/equity ratio of -1.4901 is an unusual value, suggesting that the company may have negative equity. This implies that the company's liabilities exceed its assets, which can be a sign of financial distress.

Furthermore, the net profit margin of -39.1248 indicates that the company is suffering from significant losses. This negative value suggests that the company's expenses exceed its revenues, resulting in a loss-making operation. The return on equity (ROE) and return on tangible equity (ROTE) are also negative, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient profits in relation to its equity and tangible assets.

While there are some positive indicators such as the asset turnover ratio of 0.9428 and the return on assets (ROA) of 6.7291, these are not sufficient to outweigh the negative indicators and improve the overall credit status of the company.

In conclusion, based on the specific financial indicators, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is facing poor credit conditions. The company's financial health is weakened by low liquidity, high levels of debt, negative profitability, and negative returns on equity and tangible equity. These factors together suggest that the company may be at a high risk of defaulting on its financial obligations."

Although Vulcan Materials Company has shown positive profitability and efficiency ratios, its negative operating cash flow per share and free cash flow per share indicate that the company is currently not generating sufficient cash flows from its operations and has negative free cash flow. This may be a concern for potential creditors and investors.

Overall, Vulcan Materials Company demonstrates a good credit status based on its liquidity, debt position, profitability, asset utilization, and return ratios.

Several key ratios and margins can be used to assess the overall credit status of the company.

Firstly, the current ratio of 0.7189 suggests that SCI may have difficulties meeting its short-term obligations, as the ratio is below the ideal value of 1. This indicates a potential lack of liquidity and may raise concerns for creditors.

Additionally, the debt/equity ratio of 2.2178 indicates that SCI has a high level of debt compared to its equity. This suggests that the company relies heavily on borrowed funds, which can increase financial risk and affect its creditworthiness.

The gross margin, operating margin, and EBIT margin, all at around 20%, depict a relatively healthy profitability for SCI. However, it is important to note that the net profit margin is significantly lower at 5.7605%.

Additionally, the negative return on tangible equity (-102.6093) is a concerning sign. This indicates that the company is not effectively utilizing its tangible assets to generate profits, which can be detrimental to its creditworthiness.

Moreover, the negative operating cash flow per share (-2.5777) and free cash flow per share (-2.4204) suggest that Oshkosh Corporation is experiencing difficulties in generating sufficient cash flow from its operations. This can limit the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or repay its debts.

It is crucial for the company to address these financial challenges and implement effective strategies to improve its creditworthiness and ensure long-term sustainability."

Several key ratios and margins indicate the company's struggle to generate sufficient profits and manage its debt effectively.

Firstly, the current ratio of 1.337 suggests that Netflix may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. While a ratio above 1 is generally considered acceptable, the relatively low value indicates potential liquidity issues.

Furthermore, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.3494 and debt/equity ratio of 0.5371 highlight the company's reliance on debt financing. These figures suggest that a significant portion of Netflix's capital structure is financed through debt, which can increase financial risk and decrease creditworthiness.

However, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.2304 and the debt/equity ratio of 0.3145 indicate that the company has a significant level of debt compared to its capital and equity. This suggests a higher financial risk.

The company's profitability is also a concern. While the gross margin of 35.4648 indicates a reasonable level of profitability, the operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin of 14.4211, 14.7838, and 17.0209 respectively, suggest that Flowserve Corp. is not generating substantial profits from its operations. The pre-tax profit margin of 13.3965 and net profit margin of 9.8021 further support this observation.

Furthermore, the poor credit rating is reinforced by the company's return on equity (ROE) of 23.7731, which indicates that Flowserve Corp. is not generating a high return on its shareholders' investments. The return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 52.7409 highlights the limited profitability of the company's tangible assets. The return on assets (ROA) of 10.081 and return on investment (ROI) of 18.296 also suggest that Flowserve Corp. is not efficiently utilizing its assets and investments.

In conclusion, Flowserve Corp. is facing financial challenges with a poor credit rating. The company's high debt levels, low profitability, and suboptimal return on investments indicate potential difficulties in meeting its financial obligations and generating sustainable growth."

Additionally, the long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.5116 suggests that the company has a relatively low level of debt compared to its capital.

The debt/equity ratio of 1.2064 implies that DTE Energy Center LLC relies more on debt financing than equity financing. While this may increase financial risk, the company's strong gross margin of 62.5807% indicates its ability to generate profit after accounting for the cost of goods sold. The operating margin, EBIT margin, and EBITDA margin of 17.2434% and 29.2903% respectively further demonstrate the company's profitability.

Furthermore, DTE Energy Center LLC is able to generate a pre-tax profit margin of 11.2845% and a net profit margin of 7.39%, indicating effective cost management and revenue generation. The return on equity (ROE) of 9.5611% and return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 13.8248% demonstrate the company's ability to generate returns for its shareholders.

2. Debt Management: The long-term debt to capital ratio of 0.4742 signifies that KEPCO relies moderately on debt financing. However, the debt/equity ratio of 1.0544 indicates a higher level of leverage, which may increase financial risk.

3. Profitability: KEPCO's gross margin of 1.3462 demonstrates a reasonable ability to generate profit from sales. However, the negative operating margin, EBIT margin, and pre-tax profit margin suggest that the company is currently operating at a loss. This could be due to various factors such as high operating expenses or low sales volumes.

4. Efficiency: The asset turnover ratio of 0.3361 indicates that KEPCO may be less efficient in utilizing its assets to generate sales. This could be a result of industry-specific factors or inefficiencies in the company's operations.

The company faces liquidity challenges and has high levels of debt, which could impact its financial stability. Additionally, the negative profitability indicators and low returns raise questions about the company's operational efficiency and ability to generate profits.
