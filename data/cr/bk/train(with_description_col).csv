The company's current ratio of 1.49 suggests it has sufficient short-term assets to cover its immediate obligations, indicating a relatively healthy liquidity position.

However, QEP Resources' profitability margins raise concerns. The net profit margin of 0.76 indicates that the company generates a decent amount of profit from its operations, but the pretax profit margin of -0.62 suggests that it is struggling to generate profits before accounting for taxes. Moreover, the operating profit margin of -0.82 reveals that the company is not efficiently managing its operational costs.

Furthermore, the return on assets of 0.08 indicates that QEP Resources may not be effectively utilizing its assets to generate profits. The return on equity of 0.19 suggests that the company is generating a satisfactory return for its equity holders.

QEP Resources' debt ratios are also a concern. The debt-equity ratio of 1.28 indicates that the company relies heavily on debt financing, potentially increasing its financial risk. The debt ratio of 0.56 further emphasizes the significant proportion of debt in the company's capital structure.

Additionally, the negative free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of -0.77 indicates that the company's cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover its capital expenditure and other financial obligations. The negative free cash flow per share of -6.58 highlights the company's inability to generate excess cash available to shareholders.

In conclusion, QEP Resources, Inc. displays satisfactory liquidity but faces challenges in terms of profitability, asset utilization, and debt management. Investors should carefully assess the company's financial health and risk profile before making any investment decisions."

The binary rating, which categorizes the company's credit status, is given a low score of 0, indicating poor credit quality.

The company's profitability metrics are particularly worrying. The net profit margin and operating profit margin are negative, indicating that Navistar International Corporation is currently experiencing losses. This is further supported by the negative return on assets and return on capital employed, which suggest that the company is not effectively utilizing its resources to generate profits. Additionally, the gross profit margin is low, suggesting that the company is struggling to generate sufficient revenue to cover its costs.

Navistar International Corporation's liquidity position is also a cause for concern. The current ratio, which measures the company's ability to meet short-term obligations, is slightly above 1, indicating that it may have some difficulty in paying off its current liabilities. The quick ratio and cash ratio, which provide a more conservative measure of liquidity, are both below 1, suggesting that the company may not have enough liquid assets to cover its immediate obligations.

The company's leverage ratios also raise red flags. The debt-equity ratio and debt ratio are both above 1, indicating that Navistar International Corporation has a high level of debt relative to its equity and assets. This increases the company's financial risk and may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns or changes in interest rates.

Overall, Navistar International Corporation's financial indicators suggest a weak credit position. The company is experiencing losses, has low profitability margins, and faces liquidity challenges and high levels of debt. These factors indicate a higher risk of default and make it less attractive to potential creditors or investors."

Oasis Petroleum Inc.'s efficiency in utilizing its assets is relatively low, with an asset turnover of 0.23. This indicates that the company is not generating substantial sales revenue from its assets. Furthermore, the debt-equity ratio of 2.49 and debt ratio of 0.71 highlight a significant reliance on debt financing, which could increase financial risk. 

The company's ability to generate free cash flow is positive, with a ratio of 1.0 indicating that it has sufficient cash flow to cover its operating expenses. Moreover, the enterprise value multiple of 7.75 suggests that the company may be undervalued in the market. 

In conclusion, Oasis Petroleum Inc.'s overall creditworthiness appears moderate. While it demonstrates profitability and sufficient free cash flow, concerns about liquidity, asset efficiency, and high debt levels may impact its credit rating. It is important for potential investors or lenders to conduct a thorough analysis of the company's financial health before making any decisions."

With a debt-equity ratio of 0.8414 and a debt ratio of 0.4569, Marathon Oil Corporation has a substantial amount of debt compared to its equity and assets. This may increase the company's financial risk and make it vulnerable to changes in interest rates or economic conditions.

Furthermore, the effective tax rate of 0.6769 indicates that Marathon Oil Corporation pays a significant portion of its earnings in taxes, which could impact its overall profitability.

In conclusion, Marathon Oil Corporation has a mixed credit profile. While it demonstrates profitability and positive credit ratings, its liquidity and leverage ratios raise concerns about its ability to meet short-term obligations and manage its debt effectively. Investors and stakeholders should closely monitor the company's financial performance and its ability to address these challenges in order to assess its long-term creditworthiness."

The company's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) stand at 2.49% and 5.46% respectively, indicating an average utilization of assets and equity to generate profits. The asset turnover ratio of 0.59 implies that Colfax Corporation is generating less revenue per unit of assets, indicating a potential inefficiency in asset utilization.

Total S.A. demonstrates a strong liquidity position, with current, quick, and cash ratios above industry averages. This indicates the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and suggests a lower risk of defaulting on its debts.

However, the company's profitability ratios are relatively low. The net profit margin and return on assets are modest, suggesting that Total S.A. may face challenges in generating profits from its assets. The gross profit margin is high, indicating efficient cost management, but the operating profit margin is similar to the net profit margin, indicating a lack of significant growth in operating income.

Total S.A.'s return on equity and return on capital employed are both below industry averages, indicating lower profitability compared to its peers. This might be attributed to the company's debt burden, as indicated by the high debt-equity and debt ratios. This high leverage could pose a risk to the company's financial stability.

The effective tax rate is shown to be zero, which could be due to tax deductions or exemptions. This might positively impact the company's cash flow, but investors should be cautious about the sustainability of such tax benefits.

In terms of cash flow, Total S.A. demonstrates a positive free cash flow per share, indicating the company's ability to generate excess cash after meeting its capital expenditure needs. The enterprise value multiple is slightly above 1, indicating that the company is valued higher than its net assets.

In conclusion, while Total S.A. has a strong liquidity position, its lower profitability, high leverage, and potential tax implications should be considered when evaluating its overall creditworthiness. Further analysis of the company's future growth prospects and ability to manage its debt obligations is recommended."

Hess Corporation, as of September 11, 2013, exhibits a mixed credit profile. While some financial indicators reflect a strong performance, others suggest areas of concern. 

In terms of liquidity and solvency, the company has a current ratio of 1.31, indicating adequate short-term liquidity to meet its obligations. However, the quick ratio of 0.98 suggests a lower ability to cover immediate liabilities without relying on inventory. The cash ratio is also relatively low at 0.28, potentially indicating limited cash reserves.

Profitability ratios demonstrate a relatively positive picture for Hess Corporation. The net profit margin of 0.21 indicates a reasonable level of profitability, while the gross profit margin of 0.91 suggests efficient cost management. However, the operating profit margin and pre-tax profit margin are the same at 0.18, which may indicate limited ability to generate profits after operating expenses and taxes.

Return on assets (ROA) and return on capital employed (ROCE) are at 0.12 and 0.12 respectively, indicating moderate profitability relative to the assets and capital employed. The return on equity (ROE) of 0.20 suggests that the company is generating a satisfactory return for its shareholders.

The debt equity ratio of 0.73 and debt ratio of 0.42 indicate a moderate level of leverage, which might be a cause for concern. The effective tax rate of 0.12 suggests a relatively low tax burden.

Cash flow indicators paint a slightly concerning picture. The free cash flow operating cash flow ratio is negative, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is insufficient to cover its free cash flow requirements. The free cash flow per share is also negative, indicating a potential need for external financing.

In conclusion, Hess Corporation demonstrates a mixed credit profile with strengths in profitability and moderate leverage, but potential concerns in liquidity and cash flow. Further analysis and monitoring are necessary to assess the long-term sustainability of the company's credit position."

The company's asset turnover and fixed asset turnover ratios suggest that PPL Corporation may have a lower efficiency in utilizing its assets to generate sales. The high debt equity ratio and debt ratio indicate that the company has a significant amount of debt in its capital structure.

Despite these indicators, PPL Corporation has a positive enterprise value multiple, which suggests that the company is valued higher than its operating cash flow. However, the free cash flow operating cash flow ratio and free cash flow per share are negative, indicating that the company may have limited cash flow available for investments or distributions to shareholders.

The cash ratio of 0.277 indicates that the company has a relatively low level of cash compared to its current liabilities.

The company's profitability ratios are also moderate. The net profit margin of 0.033 suggests that Murphy Oil Corporation generates a modest profit from its operations. The return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity ratios indicate that the company is able to generate reasonable returns on its investments, although not exceptionally high.

Murphy Oil Corporation's liquidity ratios indicate that the company may face some challenges in managing its cash flow.

The company's return on assets and return on capital employed are 0.0484 and 0.1879, respectively, suggesting decent efficiency in utilizing assets and capital.

Centene Corporation's financial leverage is evident from its debt-equity ratio of 2.4024 and company equity multiplier of 3.4024. These ratios highlight a higher level of debt compared to equity, potentially increasing financial vulnerability.

However, the company's debt-equity ratio and debt ratio are significantly high, indicating a heavy reliance on debt financing.

The company's profitability ratios are mixed. With a net profit margin of 0.050797956, ConocoPhillips generates a modest profit from each dollar of revenue. The pretax profit margin of 0.09368375 indicates a lower profitability level before accounting for taxes. The gross profit margin of 1.0 implies that the company has a high percentage of revenue left after deducting the cost of goods sold. The operating profit margin, which is the same as the net profit margin, suggests that operating expenses have a significant impact on overall profitability.

ConocoPhillips has a healthy return on assets of 0.081159042, indicating its ability to generate returns from its total assets. The return on capital employed and return on equity stand at 0.183242518 and 0.190666013, respectively, indicating that the company efficiently utilizes its capital and shareholder investments. 

The company's debt ratios are concerning. With a debt-equity ratio of 1.349288605 and a debt ratio of 0.574339229, ConocoPhillips relies heavily on debt financing, which may increase its financial risk.

Overall, ConocoPhillips demonstrates satisfactory liquidity and profitability levels, efficient utilization of assets, and a moderate credit condition. However, its high debt levels should be closely monitored to ensure long-term sustainability."

Comcast's liquidity ratios, including the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio, indicate a relatively healthy ability to meet short-term obligations. However, the days of sales outstanding metric implies that the company takes an extended period to collect its receivables, which could impact its cash flow.

The profitability indicators, such as net profit margin, pretax profit margin, and gross profit margin, demonstrate moderate profitability levels. Although the operating profit margin appears favorable, it is important to note that the effective tax rate is relatively high, potentially impacting the company's profitability.

Comcast's return on assets and return on equity figures suggest moderate performance, indicating that the company generates a modest return on its investment. The asset turnover and fixed asset turnover ratios indicate the efficiency of asset utilization, with the latter exhibiting a relatively high ratio.

The debt-equity ratio and debt ratio highlight the company's reliance on debt financing, which could increase its financial risk. The enterprise value multiple indicates the market's perception of the company's value.

Furthermore, Comcast's free cash flow operating cash flow ratio and free cash flow per share show a positive cash flow position, indicating its ability to generate cash from its operations.

In summary, Comcast Corporation demonstrates a mixed credit profile. While the company exhibits relatively favorable liquidity and profitability metrics, its high debt levels and extended days of sales outstanding could potentially impact its financial stability. It is crucial for investors and stakeholders to consider these factors when assessing Comcast's creditworthiness."

Edgewell Personal Care, as of February 23, 2016, demonstrates a mixed credit performance. The company's current ratio of 2.454 indicates a healthy liquidity position, implying its ability to cover short-term obligations. However, the quick ratio of 1.488 suggests a relatively lower ability to meet immediate liabilities.

Additionally, the operating profit margin of -0.189 further affirms the company's struggle to generate profits after considering operating expenses.

Return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity, with values of -0.055, -0.106, and -0.148 respectively, indicate negative returns, suggesting inefficient utilization of assets, capital, and equity. 

Edgewell Personal Care's debt-equity ratio of 1.678 reveals a higher reliance on debt financing, potentially exposing the company to financial risks. The debt ratio of 0.627 also indicates a significant proportion of debt in the company's capital structure.

The effective tax rate of 0.354 implies that the company is subject to a moderate tax burden. The free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of 0.332 indicates that the company has generated a reasonable amount of free cash flow relative to its operating cash flow.

Overall, Edgewell Personal Care faces challenges in generating profits and effectively utilizing its assets, capital, and equity.

IGT's return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are all below average. This indicates that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets, capital, and shareholder equity to generate returns for its investors.

Furthermore, IGT has a high debt-equity ratio and debt ratio, indicating a significant reliance on debt financing. This may expose the company to higher financial risks.

On a positive note, IGT has a relatively high fixed asset turnover, suggesting efficient utilization of its fixed assets. Additionally, the company has a positive free cash flow, indicating its ability to generate cash from its operations.

Overall, based on the financial indicators provided, IGT's credit condition appears to be relatively weak. The company faces challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, and return on investment. Additionally, its high debt levels pose potential risks. It is recommended that investors and creditors closely monitor IGT's financial performance and assess its ability to improve its creditworthiness in the future."

Whiting Petroleum has a high debt-equity ratio of 1.397397257 and a debt ratio of 0.582880978, indicating a significant reliance on debt financing. This poses a risk to the company's financial stability and increases its vulnerability to changes in interest rates.

In terms of cash flow, Whiting Petroleum has a strong free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of 1.0, indicating that it is generating sufficient cash flow from its operations. However, the negative enterprise value multiple of -6.444172692 suggests that the company's value is significantly lower than its market capitalization.

Overall, Whiting Petroleum Corporation is facing financial difficulties, with poor liquidity, negative profitability, high debt levels, and a low market valuation. These factors indicate a weak credit position and suggest that the company may struggle to meet its financial obligations."

Terex Corporation demonstrates a moderate level of creditworthiness. The company's current ratio indicates a strong ability to meet short-term obligations, while the quick ratio suggests a relatively low level of liquidity. Additionally, the cash ratio indicates that the company has a significant portion of its assets in cash or cash equivalents, providing a cushion for unexpected financial obligations.

Terex Corporation's profitability margins, including net profit margin, gross profit margin, and operating profit margin, are relatively low. This indicates that the company's ability to generate profits from its operations is limited. Furthermore, the return on assets and return on equity ratios indicate a moderate level of efficiency in utilizing its assets and equity.

The company's debt-equity ratio and debt ratio are relatively high, suggesting a significant reliance on debt to finance its operations. This increases the financial risk and vulnerability of Terex Corporation to economic downturns or changes in interest rates.

Terex Corporation's fixed asset turnover ratio is high, indicating efficient utilization of its fixed assets to generate revenue. However, the payables turnover ratio is relatively low, suggesting a potential delay in paying its obligations to suppliers.

The effective tax rate is relatively high, indicating a significant tax burden on the company's profits. Moreover, the negative free cash flow operating cash flow ratio and free cash flow per share indicate a negative cash flow situation, which may limit the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or return value to shareholders.

In conclusion, Terex Corporation exhibits a moderate level of creditworthiness. While the company has strong liquidity and efficient utilization of fixed assets, its profitability margins and high debt levels pose some risks to its overall financial stability. Additionally, the negative cash flow situation and high tax burden need to be addressed to enhance the company's creditworthiness."

The effective tax rate of 0.42 suggests that the company faces a moderate tax burden. The free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of 0.26 indicates that the company generates sufficient cash flow from its operations to cover its capital expenditures and meet financial obligations.

This lack of profitability may make it challenging for the company to service its debt obligations and maintain a strong credit profile.

Additionally, the debt and leverage ratios reveal a relatively high level of indebtedness. The debt-equity ratio of 1.72 indicates that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which increases its financial risk.

IBM's return on assets and return on capital employed suggest that the company effectively utilizes its assets and capital to generate returns. However, the return on equity is notably high, indicating that IBM may rely heavily on debt to finance its operations. This is supported by the high debt equity ratio and debt ratio, which suggest a relatively higher level of financial risk. 

IBM's asset turnover and fixed asset turnover ratios suggest effective utilization of its assets, particularly its fixed assets. This indicates that IBM is efficiently generating revenue from its assets. 

The effective tax rate and enterprise value multiple provide additional insights into IBM's financial health. The effective tax rate suggests a moderate tax burden, while the enterprise value multiple indicates the market's perception of IBM's overall value.

Lastly, IBM's free cash flow ratios, including the free cash flow to operating cash flow ratio and free cash flow per share, indicate a relatively healthy cash position and ability to generate cash flow from operations. 

Overall, IBM's credit profile reflects a mix of strengths and weaknesses. While it demonstrates profitability, efficient asset utilization, and relatively strong liquidity, its high reliance on debt and lower cash availability may warrant attention."

Alkermes plc's liquidity ratios, such as the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio, are above 1, suggesting that the company has enough short-term assets to cover its current liabilities. However, the days of sales outstanding, which measures the average collection period for receivables, is 0, indicating that the company may be facing challenges in collecting payments from customers.

Furthermore, the company's debt-related indicators, including the debt-equity ratio and debt ratio, are relatively high. This suggests that Alkermes plc relies heavily on debt financing, which poses a risk to its financial stability.

Despite these challenges, Alkermes plc has a favorable free cash flow operating cash flow ratio and free cash flow per share, indicating that the company generates sufficient cash flow from its operating activities. However, the enterprise value multiple is quite high, suggesting that the company may be overvalued in the market.

In conclusion, Alkermes plc's overall credit situation is concerning, with negative profitability ratios, high debt levels, and possible challenges in collecting payments. The company's ability to generate free cash flow is a positive aspect, but it should address the underlying issues to improve its creditworthiness and financial stability."

In terms of liquidity, the company has a strong current ratio of 1.825, indicating its ability to meet short-term liabilities. Additionally, the quick ratio of 1.3375 shows that Valvoline Inc. has a good level of quick assets to cover immediate obligations. However, the cash ratio of 0.43 suggests that the company may have limited cash on hand compared to its current liabilities.

Profitability ratios also offer insights into the company's creditworthiness. Valvoline Inc. has a net profit margin of 0.1415, indicating that it generates a reasonable profit from its sales. The pretax profit margin of 0.2182 further demonstrates the company's ability to generate profit before taxes. However, the return on equity is negative, suggesting that the company is not efficient in utilizing shareholder investments.

Valvoline Inc.'s leverage ratios reveal some concerning indicators.

However, its negative return on equity and high debt levels raise concerns about its creditworthiness. While the company has a strong cash flow, its negative equity position and reliance on debt financing may impact its overall credit rating."

However, it is important to note that the cash ratio is the same as the quick ratio, indicating that the company has a relatively low level of cash on hand compared to its current liabilities.

The company's profitability margins are mixed. While the gross profit margin is at a healthy 12.88%, the net profit margin is negative at -0.049%. This suggests that the company's expenses are outweighing its revenues and it is operating at a loss. Additionally, the operating profit margin of 3.53% indicates that the company's operational efficiency is relatively low.

Olin Corporation's return on assets and return on equity are both negative, indicating that the company is not generating satisfactory returns on its assets and shareholder investments. Furthermore, the debt equity ratio of 2.854 indicates a relatively high level of debt compared to equity, which could be a cause for concern.

The company's free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of 0.397 suggests that Olin Corporation has a moderate ability to generate free cash flow from its operations. However, it is essential to note that the effective tax rate is high at 120.9%, which could impact the company's cash flows.

Overall, Olin Corporation's financial indicators reflect a mixed credit condition. While the company has adequate liquidity and some profitability, its negative net profit margin, low returns, high debt equity ratio, and high tax rate raise concerns about its financial stability and ability to generate sustainable profits."
