The current ratio of 2.87 indicates that the company has a relatively strong ability to meet its short-term obligations. However, the quick ratio of 1.46 and the cash ratio of 0.64 suggest that the company's liquidity position may be somewhat weaker. This implies that the company may face challenges in generating sufficient cash to cover its immediate liabilities.

The days of sales outstanding of 43.31 indicates that the company takes an average of 43.31 days to collect payments from its customers. A higher number suggests a longer collection period, which can impact cash flow and liquidity.

The net profit margin, pretax profit margin, gross profit margin, and operating profit margin indicate the profitability of the company. With net profit margin at 1.52% and operating profit margin at 2.49%, it suggests that the company has relatively low profit margins compared to its revenue and operating costs. This may be a result of higher expenses or lower revenue generation.

Overall, the combination of weaker liquidity, low profit margins, inefficient utilization of assets, capital, and equity, and higher debt levels contribute to the poor credit status of Briggs & Stratton Corporation. The company may need to focus on improving its liquidity position, profitability, and debt management in order to enhance its creditworthiness."

This assessment is based on various factors, including the company's current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio.

The current ratio, which measures the company's ability to pay off its short-term obligations, is 1.63. While this indicates that the company has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities, it is not significantly higher than the ideal ratio of 2. A higher ratio would suggest a better ability to meet short-term financial obligations.

Similarly, the quick ratio, which measures the company's ability to pay off its current liabilities using its most liquid assets, is 1.15. Again, this is below the ideal ratio of 1. A lower quick ratio indicates a higher risk of being unable to meet short-term obligations.

The cash ratio, which measures the company's ability to cover its current liabilities using only cash and cash equivalents, is 0.10. This indicates a low level of cash reserves, potentially limiting the company's ability to cover immediate financial obligations.

Furthermore, the return on equity, which measures the profitability of the company in relation to its shareholders' equity, is -0.24. A negative return on equity suggests that the company is not generating sufficient profits to provide a return to its shareholders.

Overall, these indicators paint a concerning picture of HCA Healthcare, Inc.'s credit status. The company's liquidity ratios and profitability indicators are below ideal levels, indicating potential financial challenges and a higher risk of defaulting on its financial obligations.

This conclusion is drawn based on a thorough analysis of various financial indicators. The company's current ratio, a measure of its short-term liquidity, stands at 1.36, indicating that it has sufficient current assets to cover its short-term liabilities. However, the quick ratio, which excludes inventory from current assets, is 0.77, suggesting a potential issue in the company's ability to convert assets into cash quickly.

Additionally, the cash ratio of 0.007 reflects a low level of cash reserves compared to its current liabilities. This may indicate a potential cash flow problem for the company. Moreover, the days of sales outstanding, which measures the average number of days it takes to collect revenue from customers, is relatively high at 9.67. This suggests that the company may be facing difficulties in collecting payments from its customers, further impacting its cash flow.

Furthermore, the profitability indicators paint a bleak picture for Global Partners LP. The net profit margin, pretax profit margin, gross profit margin, and operating profit margin are all relatively low, indicating weak profitability. These low margins can be attributed to various factors such as high operating costs, intense competition, and potentially unfavorable market conditions.

The company's return on assets (ROA) and return on capital employed (ROCE) are 0.055 and 0.089, respectively, both of which are below industry averages. This implies that Global Partners LP is not effectively utilizing its assets and capital to generate profits. Additionally, the return on equity (ROE) of 0.192 indicates that the company is not generating satisfactory returns for its shareholders.

The debt-equity ratio of 2.48 and the debt ratio of 0.71 highlight the company's heavy reliance on debt financing. This exposes Global Partners LP to higher financial risk and potential difficulties in meeting its debt obligations.

In conclusion, Global Partners LP is currently facing a poor credit status due to its low liquidity, weak profitability, inadequate returns on capital, and high debt levels. These factors collectively suggest that the company may struggle to meet its financial obligations and generate sustainable profits in the long run. It is crucial for the company to address these issues and implement strategic measures to improve its creditworthiness."

Several factors contribute to this assessment.

Firstly, the company's profitability is relatively low. The net profit margin, which indicates the proportion of revenue that translates into profit, stands at 0.1065. This suggests that NVIDIA is not efficiently converting its sales into earnings. Additionally, the pretax profit margin and operating profit margin are also relatively low, further indicating the company's struggle to generate significant profits.

Furthermore, NVIDIA's liquidity position is not favorable. The current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio are 5.9489, 1.6689, and 1.2179, respectively. These figures indicate that the company may face challenges in meeting its short-term obligations and maintaining sufficient cash reserves.

The company's debt-related ratios also raise concerns. The debt-equity ratio is high at 1.6271, suggesting a significant reliance on borrowed funds. Additionally, the debt ratio is 1.0, indicating that NVIDIA's total liabilities are equal to its total assets. This indicates a high level of financial risk and potential difficulties in managing its debt obligations.

Moreover, the company's return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are relatively low. These ratios indicate that NVIDIA is not efficiently utilizing its assets and capital to generate returns for its shareholders.

Overall, the combination of low profitability, liquidity challenges, high debt levels, and suboptimal returns on investments suggests a poor credit status for NVIDIA Corporation.

Firstly, Visteon Corporation's profitability margins are relatively low. The net profit margin, which measures the company's ability to generate profits from its revenue, stands at 9.28%. This indicates that the company's profitability is not strong, which could be a cause for concern for potential creditors.

The company's current ratio of 1.340914312 suggests that it may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. Additionally, its quick ratio of 0.528830691 indicates a lower ability to cover immediate liabilities with its most liquid assets.

The cash ratio of 0.249712842 further highlights the company's limited cash reserves, which may hinder its ability to handle unexpected expenses or invest in growth opportunities. Moreover, the days of sales outstanding, at 21.11407167, indicates that Navistar International Corporation takes relatively longer to collect payments from its customers, potentially impacting its cash flow.

The negative net profit margin of -0.232468335 and pretax profit margin of -0.09128823 reveal that the company is not generating sufficient profits from its operations. This, coupled with the negative operating profit margin and return on assets, suggests inefficiencies in the company's operations and a lack of profitability.

The return on equity of 0.909365559 appears to be an anomaly, as it indicates a strong return on shareholder's equity. However, given the overall poor credit status of the company, it is advisable to scrutinize this indicator further.

The debt-equity ratio of -3.749848943 and debt ratio of 1.363656339 demonstrate a significant imbalance between debt and equity, indicating potential financial instability. Furthermore, the negative effective tax rate and enterprise value multiple indicate potential tax and valuation challenges faced by the company.

In summary, Navistar International Corporation is facing various financial challenges, including limited liquidity, low profitability, and a skewed debt-equity structure. These factors collectively contribute to the company's poor credit status and suggest a need for careful evaluation and potential corrective measures to improve its financial health."

Firstly, the company's liquidity position is relatively weak. With a current ratio of 1.735911668 and a quick ratio of 1.563424155, Navios Maritime Holdings Inc. may struggle to meet its short-term obligations. Although the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, it indicates that a significant portion of its assets may be tied up in inventory or other non-liquid assets.

Furthermore, Navios Maritime Holdings Inc. has a high debt burden, as reflected by its debt equity ratio of 2.226558939 and debt ratio of 0.641657195. This suggests that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which can increase its financial risk and make it vulnerable to economic downturns or changes in interest rates.

In terms of profitability, Navios Maritime Holdings Inc. has a net profit margin and pretax profit margin of 0.21437438 and 0.214983277, respectively. While these figures indicate the company's ability to generate profits from its operations, they are relatively low compared to industry peers. This may be attributed to various factors such as intense competition, fluctuating commodity prices, or inefficient cost management.

Navios Maritime Holdings Inc.'s return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity stand at 0.039642708, 0.0725701, and 0.13756072, respectively. These figures suggest that the company's profitability in relation to its total assets, capital employed, and shareholders' equity is relatively low. This indicates that the company may not be effectively utilizing its resources to generate returns for its investors.

Additionally, Navios Maritime Holdings Inc.'s free cash flow operating cash flow ratio is negative (-2.08934431), indicating that the company is generating insufficient cash flow from its operations to cover its capital expenditures and debt obligations. This raises concerns about its ability to fund future growth or meet its financial obligations.

Overall, based on the provided financial indicators, Navios Maritime Holdings Inc. is experiencing poor credit conditions. The company's liquidity position, high debt burden, relatively low profitability, and negative free cash flow operating cash flow ratio all contribute to its unfavorable credit status.

Similarly, the quick ratio of 1.16 suggests that the company has a decent ability to meet its short-term obligations. However, the cash ratio of 0.34 suggests that Sanmina may face challenges in covering its immediate liabilities solely with its available cash.

In terms of profitability, Sanmina's net profit margin is 0.03, indicating that the company generates a modest profit from its operations. The pretax profit margin, however, is negative at -0.001, indicating that the company's profitability is adversely affected by pre-tax expenses. The gross profit margin of 0.07 suggests that Sanmina has a reasonable level of profitability after accounting for the cost of goods sold. 

Sanmina's return on assets (ROA) is 0.06, implying that the company efficiently utilizes its assets to generate profits. The return on equity (ROE) stands at 0.19, indicating that the company generates a favorable return for its shareholders. However, the return on capital employed (ROCE) is negative at -0.004, suggesting that the company's capital investments are not generating sufficient returns.

The company's debt-equity ratio is 2.29, indicating that Sanmina relies heavily on debt financing. This high level of debt increases the company's financial risk. The debt ratio of 0.70 suggests that the company's assets are significantly financed by debt.

Furthermore, Sanmina's effective tax rate is 17.26, indicating the proportion of its earnings that are paid in taxes. The company's free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of 0.63 suggests that Sanmina generates a reasonable amount of free cash flow from its operations. 

In summary, Sanmina Corporation currently exhibits a poor credit status. While the company demonstrates decent liquidity and profitability ratios, its negative ROCE and high debt levels pose risks to its financial health. Additionally, the company's negative pretax profit margin highlights potential challenges in managing expenses effectively. Sanmina should focus on improving its return on capital employed and reducing its reliance on debt to enhance its overall creditworthiness."

Several key ratios and margins paint a concerning picture of the company's financial health.

The current ratio, which measures the ability to meet short-term obligations, is above the ideal value of 1. A ratio of 2.461 suggests that the company has more than enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. However, the quick ratio of 1.059 indicates that the company's ability to generate cash quickly may be compromised. This could potentially lead to difficulties in meeting immediate financial obligations.

The net profit margin, pretax profit margin, and return on assets all show negative values. This implies that the company is not efficiently generating profits or utilizing its assets effectively. Furthermore, the return on equity is also negative, indicating a lack of profitability for shareholders.

The debt equity ratio and debt ratio highlight a significant reliance on debt financing, with values of 2.421 and 0.707, respectively. This suggests a higher risk for the company, as excessive debt can strain its ability to repay creditors.

The effective tax rate is exceptionally high at 0.969, indicating a significant tax burden on the company's profits. This could further impact its financial performance and hinder its ability to generate positive cash flows.

Despite these concerning indicators, Griffon Corporation does show some positive aspects. The gross profit margin and operating profit margin are 0.230 and 0.039, respectively, indicating some level of profitability. Additionally, the asset turnover and fixed asset turnover ratios suggest efficient utilization of assets.

In conclusion, while Griffon Corporation exhibits some positive financial indicators, such as efficient asset utilization and profitability margins, the overall credit status of the company is poor. The negative net profit margin, high debt ratios, and excessive tax burden are significant concerns that may hinder the company's financial stability and creditworthiness."

This may limit the company's ability to expand or invest in new projects.

In conclusion, based on the evaluation of various financial indicators, CEVA, Inc. is currently facing poor credit status. Although the company demonstrates strong liquidity, its profitability and utilization of assets and capital are suboptimal. Additionally, the negative effective tax rate and low debt ratio raise concerns about the company's financial management and growth prospects.

The company's binary rating of 0 suggests that it may face difficulties in meeting its financial obligations. 

Several key indicators point towards this poor credit status. The current ratio, which measures the company's ability to meet short-term liabilities, is 1.14. While this indicates that the company has some liquidity, it is still relatively low and may imply potential difficulties in paying off immediate obligations.

The quick ratio, which excludes inventory from current assets, is 0.76. This suggests that the company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities without relying on inventory is relatively weak.

The cash ratio, which measures the company's ability to pay off current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents, is 0.44. This indicates that the company has limited cash reserves to meet its immediate obligations.

Additionally, the debt ratio is 0.61, indicating that a significant portion of the company's assets is financed through debt. This increases the company's financial risk and may make it more challenging for PTC Inc. to secure additional financing in the future.

Furthermore, the effective tax rate is -0.79, indicating that the company may have experienced losses in recent periods, resulting in a negative tax liability. This further adds to the company's financial challenges and may impact its creditworthiness.

This conclusion is drawn from a combination of factors such as a low binary rating, low quick ratio, and high debt ratio.

The binary rating, which is an overall measure of creditworthiness, is the first indicator of the company's poor credit status. A binary rating of 0 suggests a lower credit quality and a higher risk of default. This rating alone is concerning for potential lenders or investors.

The quick ratio, which measures a company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets, is also low. A quick ratio of 0.291035238 indicates that Terex Corporation may have difficulty covering its immediate liabilities with its available liquid assets. This raises concerns about the company's liquidity and ability to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner.

Furthermore, the high debt ratio of 0.661622807 suggests that Terex Corporation relies heavily on debt financing to support its operations. A high debt ratio can be indicative of financial strain and a higher risk of default. Lenders and investors may view this as a red flag, as it increases the company's vulnerability to market fluctuations and economic downturns.

In addition to these indicators, Terex Corporation's net profit margin, pretax profit margin, and operating profit margin are also relatively low. These margins measure the company's profitability and efficiency in generating profits from its operations. The low margins suggest that the company may be facing challenges in generating consistent and sustainable profits.

Overall, the combination of a low binary rating, low quick ratio, high debt ratio, and low profitability indicators points to a poor credit status for Terex Corporation. Lenders and investors should exercise caution when considering any financial transactions with the company. It is essential to conduct further analysis and due diligence to fully understand the company's financial health and outlook."

The company's overall credit status can be summarized as follows:

Endo International plc's liquidity position is not very strong, as indicated by its current ratio of 1.067. This suggests that the company may face difficulties in meeting its short-term obligations. Additionally, the quick ratio of 0.530 indicates a low ability to cover immediate liabilities with its most liquid assets. The cash ratio of 0.132 highlights the company's limited cash reserves, which may hinder its ability to handle unexpected expenses.

The company's profitability margins paint a bleak picture. With a net profit margin of -0.251 and a pretax profit margin of -0.391, Endo International plc is experiencing significant losses. The gross profit margin of 0.513 suggests a relatively small profit margin after accounting for the cost of goods sold. The operating profit margin of -0.312 further emphasizes the company's inability to generate profits from its core operations.

Endo International plc's return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity ratios are negative, indicating poor management of resources and investments. The asset turnover ratio of 0.264 suggests that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate sales. The high debt equity ratio of 3.594 and debt ratio of 0.782 indicate a heavy reliance on borrowed funds, which poses a risk to its financial stability.

The effective tax rate of 0.357 signifies the company's tax burden, reducing its overall profitability. The free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of 0.762 suggests that the company is generating positive cash flow from its operations, but it is not sufficient to cover its free cash flow per share of 1.752. The enterprise value multiple of -29.175 indicates that the company's value is currently significantly lower than its market price.

In conclusion, based on the above financial indicators, Endo International plc's credit status is poor. The company faces challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, and overall financial performance. It needs to address its high debt levels, improve its profit margins, and enhance its ability to generate cash flow to enhance its creditworthiness."

Furthermore, the company's profitability ratios are favorable. The net profit margin of 0.086 suggests that Northrop Grumman is effective at managing its costs and generating profits from its operations. The return on equity of 0.286 indicates that the company is efficient in utilizing its shareholders' investments to generate returns.

In terms of asset management, Northrop Grumman has an asset turnover of 0.902, which implies that it efficiently utilizes its assets to generate revenue. Additionally, the fixed asset turnover ratio of 8.017 indicates that the company effectively manages its fixed assets to generate sales.

Return on assets and return on capital employed are both below 1, indicating that the company may not be effectively utilizing its assets and capital to generate profits. The return on equity is relatively low, suggesting that shareholders may not be earning a significant return on their investments.

Caesars Entertainment Corporation has a high debt equity ratio, indicating a heavy reliance on debt financing. The debt ratio is also high, indicating a significant proportion of the company's assets are financed through debt. This could increase the company's financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns.

The effective tax rate is negative, which is unusual and may be a result of certain tax benefits or deductions. The free cash flow operating cash flow ratio and free cash flow per share are negative, indicating that the company may not be generating sufficient cash flow from its operations to cover its capital expenditures and dividends.

In conclusion, Caesars Entertainment Corporation's overall credit status is poor, with low liquidity, profitability challenges, and a high level of debt. The company may need to focus on improving its operational efficiency, reducing costs, and managing its debt levels to enhance its creditworthiness."

Several key indicators suggest potential financial challenges and weaknesses within the organization.

Firstly, the current ratio of 2.496 indicates that the company may struggle to cover its short-term obligations with its current assets. While a ratio above 1 is generally considered favorable, this value suggests a potential liquidity risk. Similarly, the quick ratio of 2.022, which measures the company's ability to meet immediate liabilities, also raises concerns.

Furthermore, the debt-equity ratio of 1.700 signifies a significant reliance on debt financing, indicating potential financial strain. This is supported by the debt ratio of 0.630, suggesting that a large portion of the company's assets is financed through debt. Such high debt levels can increase the risk of default and hinder the company's ability to generate profits.

Additionally, the negative free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of -0.361 indicates that the company is not generating enough cash flow from its operations to cover its capital expenditures and other financial obligations. This can limit the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or repay its debts.

Moreover, the effective tax rate of 0.356 suggests a relatively high tax burden, which can further strain the company's financial performance. The net profit margin of 0.026 and return on assets of 0.021 also indicate relatively low profitability and efficiency.

Overall, these indicators paint a challenging picture for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation, with signs of potential liquidity risks, high debt levels, and limited profitability. It is crucial for the company to address these weaknesses and implement strategies to improve its financial health and creditworthiness."

Several key metrics reflect this assessment. The company's net profit margin, which measures the profitability of its operations, is relatively low at 3.57%.

Additionally, the return on equity is negative, indicating that Vector Group Ltd. is not effectively utilizing its shareholders' investments to generate returns.

Furthermore, the debt-equity ratio is significantly negative at -736.14%, implying that the company has a substantial amount of debt compared to its equity. This high level of debt can be concerning, as it may indicate financial instability and an increased risk of defaulting on its obligations.

The liquidity ratios also raise concerns about Vector Group Ltd.'s creditworthiness. While the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio are all above 1, suggesting the company has sufficient short-term assets to cover its liabilities, they are not particularly strong. This indicates that the company may face difficulties in meeting its short-term obligations promptly.

In terms of efficiency, the asset turnover is relatively low at 1.26, indicating that Vector Group Ltd. is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate sales. Additionally, the fixed asset turnover is exceptionally high, suggesting that the company may have excessive fixed assets relative to its sales.

Overall, the combination of low profitability, negative return on equity, high debt levels, and subpar liquidity ratios indicate that Vector Group Ltd. is in a poor credit position. These indicators highlight potential financial risks and may make lenders and investors cautious about extending credit or investing in the company."

Several key indicators contribute to this assessment.

The current ratio of 1.26 suggests that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. A ratio below 2 is generally considered weak, indicating potential liquidity issues. Additionally, the quick ratio of 0.88 further supports this notion, as it reveals that the company's ability to cover immediate liabilities with its most liquid assets is insufficient.

HCA Healthcare's net profit margin of 4.36% indicates that the company retains a relatively small portion of its revenue as profit. This may be attributed to high operating costs or low pricing power. Similarly, the return on equity of -16.61% suggests that the company is not generating favorable returns for its shareholders.

The debt ratios reveal a concerning financial position. The debt-equity ratio of -3.91 indicates that the company has a negative equity, implying a higher level of debt compared to its assets. Additionally, the debt ratio of 134.41% indicates a significant reliance on debt financing, which can increase financial risk and strain the company's ability to meet its obligations.

Furthermore, the company's return on assets of 5.72% and return on capital employed of 9.08% indicate relatively low profitability and efficiency in utilizing its assets and capital.

In summary, HCA Healthcare, Inc. faces challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, and financial risk.

The debt-equity ratio of 4.694 indicates a high level of debt in relation to equity, which suggests a heavy reliance on borrowed funds. Additionally, the debt ratio of 0.824 implies that a significant portion of the company's assets are financed through debt.

Verint's debt-equity ratio is quite high at 13.257, suggesting that the company relies heavily on debt financing. This high debt burden may increase Verint's risk and make it vulnerable to changes in interest rates or economic downturns.

In terms of cash flow, Verint has a free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of 0.879, which indicates that the company generates a decent amount of free cash flow relative to its operating cash flow. This suggests that Verint has some flexibility in using its cash for investment or debt repayment.

Overall, Verint Systems Inc. faces some challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, and debt management. The company's poor credit rating suggests that it may have difficulties meeting its financial obligations and may be considered a higher risk for lenders and investors. Verint would benefit from improving its liquidity position, reducing its debt burden, and increasing its profitability to enhance its creditworthiness."

In terms of liquidity, CoreLogic has a current ratio of 0.882, indicating that its ability to meet short-term obligations is moderate. The quick ratio of 0.590 suggests a lower capacity to cover immediate liabilities with its most liquid assets. Additionally, the cash ratio of 0.161 reveals a limited ability to generate cash to meet obligations.

Profitability indicators also contribute to the poor credit rating. The net profit margin of 0.084 indicates that the company only retains a small portion of each dollar of sales as profit. Similarly, the pretax profit margin of 0.113 and operating profit margin of 0.133 demonstrate relatively low profitability levels. 

Solvency is another concern as evidenced by the high debt-equity ratio of 2.527 and debt ratio of 0.716. These ratios suggest that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which increases financial risk. 

Efficiency measures show mixed results. The asset turnover ratio of 0.413 indicates that CoreLogic generates moderate sales from its assets. However, the fixed asset turnover ratio of 4.068 shows that the company efficiently utilizes its fixed assets. 

Overall, CoreLogic's poor credit status is primarily due to its weak liquidity, low profitability, high financial leverage, and relatively inefficient use of assets.

Although this ratio is slightly below 1, indicating potential difficulties in meeting short-term obligations, it is still considered acceptable.

Verizon's quick ratio, which excludes inventory from current assets, is 0.521. This suggests that the company may have some difficulty in quickly converting its assets into cash to meet immediate obligations. However, its cash ratio of 0.128 indicates that it has a reasonable amount of cash on hand to cover short-term obligations.

The company's profitability indicators are also favorable. Verizon has a net profit margin of 0.136, indicating that it generates a decent profit after accounting for all expenses. Its gross profit margin, which measures the profitability of its core operations, is 0.824, reflecting strong operational efficiency. Additionally, Verizon's return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are all positive, indicating that the company effectively utilizes its assets and capital to generate profits.

Verizon's debt ratios are relatively high, with a debt-equity ratio of 12.711 and a debt ratio of 0.927. These ratios suggest that the company has a significant amount of debt in relation to its equity and total assets.

The company's current ratio of 1.23 suggests a modest ability to meet short-term liabilities, while its quick ratio of 1.69 indicates a slightly stronger capacity to cover immediate obligations with liquid assets. Despite these relatively positive liquidity ratios, MGM Resorts International still faces challenges in its overall creditworthiness.

With a net profit margin of -1.60%, the company struggles to generate significant profits from its operations. This is further reflected in its negative return on assets and equity, indicating inefficiency in utilizing its resources to generate returns for shareholders. Additionally, the company's gross profit margin of 91.39% implies high costs of goods sold, potentially impacting its profitability.

The company's current ratio, which measures its ability to meet short-term obligations, stands at 2.59, indicating a relatively healthy liquidity position. However, its quick ratio, a more stringent measure of liquidity, is at 1.79, suggesting a potential vulnerability to meet immediate liabilities.

Ultrapar's profitability ratios also raise concerns. The net profit margin, which gauges the company's ability to generate profit from sales, is at a low 1.99%. Similarly, the gross profit margin is at 8.88%, indicating a relatively low ability to generate profit from its operations. This is further reflected in the company's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), which are at 7.26% and 18.92% respectively. These figures suggest that Ultrapar is not efficiently utilizing its assets and shareholder equity to generate returns.

Furthermore, Ultrapar's leverage ratios reveal a significant reliance on debt financing. The debt equity ratio is at 1.60, indicating that the company has a higher proportion of debt compared to equity. Additionally, the debt ratio is at 0.62, signifying a substantial portion of the company's assets are financed by debt. This increases the financial risk for Ultrapar, especially in times of economic downturns or rising interest rates.

Although Ultrapar has a positive operating cash flow per share and a reasonable free cash flow to operating cash flow ratio, its overall credit status remains poor. The company's low profitability, reliance on debt financing, and relatively weak liquidity position contribute to this assessment. It is important for Ultrapar to address these weaknesses by improving its profitability, reducing its reliance on debt, and strengthening its liquidity position to regain a more favorable credit standing in the market."

A low cash ratio indicates that the company has limited liquid assets available to cover its immediate financial obligations, which can pose significant challenges in maintaining its operations.

Moreover, the operating profit margin, at -0.06, indicates that the company is struggling to generate profits from its core operations. This further supports the overall poor credit status of Lattice Semiconductor.

In conclusion, Lattice Semiconductor Corporation currently faces a poor credit status characterized by negative profitability indicators, high debt levels, and low liquidity. These factors collectively signify the financial challenges the company is currently experiencing. It is crucial for Lattice Semiconductor to address these issues promptly and implement strategies to improve its creditworthiness and financial performance."

Furthermore, Hanger, Inc. has a negative net profit margin of -0.018739255, indicating that it is not generating sufficient profits from its operations. This negative profitability is also reflected in the negative return on assets (-0.014563409), return on capital employed (-0.00091345), and return on equity (-0.039223553). These ratios indicate that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets or generating satisfactory returns for its shareholders.

Moreover, Hanger, Inc. has a high debt-equity ratio of 1.693294812 and a debt ratio of 0.628707561, suggesting that the company has a significant amount of debt relative to its equity. This high level of leverage increases the company's financial risk and vulnerability to economic downturns.

Additionally, the effective tax rate of -2.029087262 indicates that the company is currently facing tax-related challenges or potential tax liabilities. This further adds to the financial strain experienced by Hanger, Inc.

In summary, Hanger, Inc. is facing several financial challenges, including a weak liquidity position, negative profitability, high debt levels, and potential tax issues. These indicators collectively contribute to the overall poor credit status of the company. It is important for investors and creditors to carefully consider these factors when assessing the creditworthiness of Hanger, Inc."

This conclusion is derived from various factors including liquidity, profitability, and leverage ratios.

Firstly, the current ratio of 1.292 suggests that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations as it has only slightly more current assets than current liabilities. Additionally, the quick ratio of 0.905 indicates that the company's ability to cover immediate liabilities with its most liquid assets is weak. These liquidity ratios imply potential difficulties in managing day-to-day operations and meeting short-term financial obligations.

Profitability ratios further contribute to the poor credit status. The net profit margin of 0.023 and the pretax profit margin of 0.021 indicate that the company generates low profits relative to its revenue. Similarly, the gross profit margin of 1.0 suggests that the company's cost of goods sold is equal to its revenue, leaving little room for profitability. Moreover, the return on assets of 0.046 and return on capital employed of 0.048 indicate that the company may not be efficiently utilizing its assets and capital to generate profits.

Another concerning aspect is the company's leverage ratios. The debt-equity ratio of 1.301 and debt ratio of 0.566 suggest that Genesis Energy, L.P. relies heavily on debt financing, which increases its financial risk. This high level of indebtedness could potentially hinder the company's ability to secure additional financing in the future.

The company's current ratio of 1.87 suggests that it may struggle to meet its short-term obligations. Additionally, its quick ratio of 0.19 indicates a lack of liquid assets available to cover immediate liabilities. The cash ratio of 0.10 further emphasizes the company's limited ability to generate sufficient cash to cover short-term obligations.

Tutor Perini's net profit margin of 0.02 and pretax profit margin of 0.03 indicate relatively low profitability. The gross profit margin of 0.09 suggests that the company's cost of goods sold is relatively high compared to its revenue. The operating profit margin of 0.04 further highlights the company's challenges in generating profits from its operations.

Return on assets (ROA) is relatively low at 0.02, indicating that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets to generate profits. The return on capital employed (ROCE) and return on equity (ROE) ratios of 0.06 also point to a relatively low return for investors. Furthermore, the company's high debt-equity ratio of 1.60 and debt ratio of 0.62 indicate a heavy reliance on debt financing, which increases its financial risk.

Tutor Perini's effective tax rate of 0.36 suggests a significant tax burden, further impacting its profitability.

This suggests poor financial performance and raises concerns about its ability to generate profits in the future.

The liquidity position of CVG is also concerning. While the current ratio is above 1, indicating that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its short-term liabilities, it is not significantly higher than the minimum acceptable value of 1.

Several key ratios and margins indicate the company's financial performance and ability to meet its obligations.

The current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio all indicate the company's short-term liquidity position. With a current ratio of 1.716, the company has slightly more current assets than current liabilities, which suggests a relatively healthy liquidity position. However, the quick ratio of 1.659 indicates that the company's ability to cover immediate obligations with its most liquid assets is slightly weaker. Additionally, the cash ratio of 5.95e-05 implies that the company holds only a very small proportion of its assets in cash, which may limit its ability to meet short-term obligations.

Profitability ratios such as net profit margin, pretax profit margin, and gross profit margin shed light on the company's ability to generate profits from its operations. A net profit margin of -0.288 indicates that the company is experiencing losses, which is further reflected in the negative pretax profit margin. The gross profit margin of 1.0 suggests that the company is able to generate revenue after accounting for direct costs, but the negative net profit margin indicates that it is struggling to cover indirect costs and expenses.

Return on assets (ROA), return on capital employed (ROCE), and return on equity (ROE) are important indicators of the company's efficiency in utilizing its assets and generating returns for its shareholders. With negative values for all three ratios, it is evident that SM Energy Company is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate profits or returns for its capital providers.

The debt-equity ratio and debt ratio reflect the company's leverage and its ability to meet its debt obligations. With a debt-equity ratio of 2.035 and a debt ratio of 0.670, it is apparent that the company has a significant amount of debt relative to its equity. This high level of debt may pose challenges in meeting financial obligations and could increase the company's overall credit risk.

In conclusion, SM Energy Company's overall credit status is poor. The company is facing challenges in terms of profitability, liquidity, and debt management. It is crucial for the company to address these issues and implement strategies to improve its financial performance and creditworthiness."

This is a concerning sign as it suggests that the company is not generating enough revenue to cover its expenses. Additionally, the return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are all negative, indicating that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets and investments to generate profits. 

Furthermore, the company has a high debt-equity ratio, which means that it relies heavily on debt financing. This can be risky as it increases the company's financial obligations and can lead to difficulties in meeting debt payments. 

On a positive note, the company has a relatively strong current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio, indicating that it has enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities. However, these ratios alone do not compensate for the poor profitability and high debt levels.

In conclusion, based on the provided financial indicators, Hess Corporation's overall credit status is poor. The company is facing challenges in generating profits and has a high reliance on debt financing. It is crucial for the company to improve its profitability and reduce its debt levels to enhance its creditworthiness and financial stability."

Overall, the combination of high debt ratios, negative profitability measures, and low returns on assets and equity indicate financial weakness and a poor credit status for Beazer Homes USA, Inc. The company may face challenges in meeting its financial obligations and generating sustainable profitability in the long term."

Firstly, the current ratio, which measures the ability to cover short-term liabilities with current assets, is at a healthy level of 3.74. However, this is not sufficient to compensate for other indicators that portray a less favorable credit position. 

The quick ratio, a more stringent measure of liquidity, stands at 2.32, indicating that the company may struggle to meet immediate financial obligations. Additionally, the cash ratio of 0.79 suggests that Commercial Metals Company has a limited amount of cash readily available.

Anthem's cash ratio of 0.097 indicates that it has a relatively low level of cash compared to its short-term obligations. However, this may not be a significant concern given its current and quick ratios, which imply sufficient liquidity.

In summary, based on the financial indicators, Anthem, Inc. can be considered to have good credit. Its strong liquidity position, profitability measures, asset turnover, and moderate leverage all contribute to its positive credit status. However, it is essential to note that these assessments are based solely on financial indicators and should be complemented by a comprehensive analysis of the company's industry and market conditions to obtain a more holistic view of its creditworthiness."

While this suggests that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, it is not significantly above the ideal value of 2. Additionally, the quick ratio, a more stringent measure of liquidity, is 1.089, indicating that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations without selling inventory.

The net profit margin, a measure of profitability, is -0.016, indicating that the company is experiencing losses on its sales.

These ratios suggest that NGL Energy Partners LP is not effectively utilizing its assets and capital to generate profits.

Furthermore, the debt equity ratio is 2.357, which indicates that the company has a high level of debt relative to its equity. This may increase the financial risk for the company, as it will have higher interest payments and may struggle to meet its debt obligations.

The company's overall creditworthiness can be evaluated by analyzing various aspects of its financial performance.

Firstly, the liquidity position of the company appears to be weak. The current ratio, which measures the ability to meet short-term obligations, is slightly above 1. Although it indicates that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, it is not significantly higher, suggesting a potential risk of liquidity constraints. Similarly, the quick ratio is below 1, indicating a limited ability to cover immediate obligations without relying on inventory.

Profitability indicators also reflect a concerning financial performance. The net profit margin is negative, implying that the company is currently operating at a loss. Additionally, the return on assets and return on equity are negative, indicating that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets and shareholder investments to generate profits. The gross profit margin, which should ideally be positive, is unexpectedly reported as 1, which seems unusual and requires further investigation.

Furthermore, the debt-related indicators demonstrate a high level of leverage. The debt-equity ratio is significantly above 1, indicating that the company relies heavily on debt financing. Additionally, the debt ratio is close to 1, indicating that a large portion of the company's assets is financed through debt. These high levels of debt raise concerns about the company's ability to repay its obligations.

Overall, the credit status of Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. is poor. The company faces challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, and debt management. It is crucial for the company to address these issues and improve its financial performance to enhance its creditworthiness."

The asset turnover ratio of 0.219314038 signifies a lower level of efficiency in utilizing its assets, potentially impacting profitability ratios.

The debt-equity ratio of 1.036187612 indicates a higher reliance on debt financing, which may pose some risks in the long run. However, the company's debt ratio of 0.508886119 suggests a relatively moderate level of debt compared to its total assets.

In terms of cash flow, the free cash flow operating cash flow ratio and free cash flow per share are negative, indicating challenges in generating sufficient cash flow from operating activities. However, the operating cash flow per share of 12.39 and operating cash flow sales ratio of 0.521574405 highlight the company's ability to generate cash from its core operations.

Overall, Devon Energy Corporation exhibits a stable financial position with good credit. However, there are areas of improvement, particularly in terms of profitability and asset utilization.

The company's overall creditworthiness seems to be compromised as it exhibits several negative factors across various aspects of its financial performance.

Firstly, the company's profitability indicators are relatively low. The net profit margin, which measures the company's efficiency in generating profits from its sales, stands at a meager 3.31%. This indicates that the company is struggling to convert its revenue into substantial profits. Moreover, the pretax profit margin and gross profit margin are also below average, further highlighting the company's weak financial performance.

Additionally, Amkor Technology, Inc. is burdened with a high level of debt. The debt-equity ratio of 2.999975478 suggests that the company's debt is significantly higher than its equity. This indicates a higher risk of default and financial instability. Furthermore, the debt ratio of 0.749998467 signifies that a large portion of the company's assets is financed by debt, which could pose a challenge in meeting its financial obligations.

Furthermore, the company's liquidity position appears to be concerning.

This could potentially lead to liquidity issues and hinder the company's ability to operate smoothly.

In conclusion, Amkor Technology, Inc. is currently facing a poor credit status. The company's profitability levels are low, it carries a significant amount of debt, and its liquidity position is worrisome. These factors collectively contribute to the overall creditworthiness of the company, indicating a higher level of financial risk.

The company's binary rating of 0 indicates a negative credit outlook. Several key indicators contribute to this assessment.

Firstly, the current ratio of 0.842 reflects a relatively low level of liquidity, suggesting that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations. Similarly, the quick ratio of 0.614 further emphasizes the company's potential difficulty in covering immediate liabilities with its most liquid assets.

The cash ratio of 0.530 indicates a low level of cash reserves compared to its current liabilities, further highlighting the company's limited ability to manage short-term financial obligations.

Moreover, Boyd Gaming Corporation's high debt-equity ratio of 4.000 signifies a heavy reliance on debt financing, which can pose a significant risk to the company's financial stability. The debt ratio of 0.800 also underscores the company's substantial debt burden, potentially limiting its ability to invest in growth opportunities or weather economic downturns.

Furthermore, the negative effective tax rate of -24.725 indicates that the company's tax expenses exceed its pre-tax profits, further straining its financial position.

Although the company's gross profit margin of 0.922 reveals a high level of profitability on sales, the net profit margin of 0.191 implies that the company's overall profitability is relatively modest, considering other expenses.

In conclusion, Boyd Gaming Corporation's overall credit status is poor, primarily due to its low liquidity, high debt burden, and limited profitability. The company may face challenges in meeting its financial obligations and generating sustainable earnings."

Days of sales outstanding, at 42.878, suggest that the company takes an average of 42.878 days to collect its receivables. A higher value indicates slower cash flow and potential credit risks. 

The net profit margin, pretax profit margin, and gross profit margin indicate negative values, suggesting that the company is experiencing losses. This raises concerns about its profitability and ability to generate positive returns. 

Return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity also display negative values, indicating poor utilization of assets and capital, as well as low returns for shareholders. 

The company's debt equity ratio of 1.477 suggests a higher reliance on debt financing, which increases financial risk. The debt ratio, at 0.596, indicates that a significant portion of the company's assets is financed by debt.

The current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio all suggest that GATX Corporation may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. These ratios measure the company's ability to cover its current liabilities with its current assets, and a value below 1 indicates potential liquidity issues.

Furthermore, the debt-equity ratio and debt ratio are both high, indicating a significant reliance on debt financing. This could pose a risk to the company's financial stability and ability to generate profits in the long term.

The net profit margin, pretax profit margin, and operating profit margin are relatively low. These margins measure the company's profitability and efficiency in generating profits from its operations. A low margin suggests that GATX Corporation may be facing challenges in generating profits and controlling its costs.

The return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are also relatively low. These ratios assess the company's ability to generate returns for its shareholders and investors. A low return on equity indicates that GATX Corporation may not be utilizing its assets efficiently to generate profits.

Additionally, the free cash flow per share is negative, indicating that the company is experiencing cash outflows from its operations. This could be a sign of financial distress and a potential inability to generate enough cash to fund its operations and invest in future growth.

Similarly, the return on assets and return on equity are also negative, indicating that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets and shareholders' investments to generate profits.

Another worrying aspect is the debt-equity ratio, which is -8.97. This negative ratio suggests that the company has excessive debt compared to its equity, indicating a high level of financial risk.

In summary, based on the analysis of various financial indicators, Cresud S.A.C.I.F. y A. is facing significant credit challenges.

Laredo Petroleum, Inc. has a low current ratio of 0.86, indicating that it may have difficulty meeting its short-term financial obligations. The quick ratio of 0.83 further supports this, suggesting that the company's ability to cover immediate liabilities with its most liquid assets is limited. Additionally, the cash ratio of 0.07 implies that the company has a relatively low level of cash on hand compared to its current liabilities.

The company's profitability is also a concern. While the gross profit margin is at a healthy 100%, indicating that the company is able to generate revenue efficiently, the net profit margin of 0.33 suggests that the company's bottom line is significantly impacted by expenses.

Furthermore, the profitability ratios, including net profit margin, gross profit margin, and operating profit margin, reveal that Visteon Corporation is struggling to generate profits. The low profitability margins indicate that the company's cost structure may be inefficient, affecting its ability to generate earnings.

The return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity ratios indicate the company's ability to generate returns from its assets and capital. Visteon Corporation's low return on assets and return on capital employed ratios suggest that the company is not effectively utilizing its resources. The return on equity ratio indicates that shareholders' investments are not yielding significant returns.

Moreover, the debt ratios, such as the debt equity ratio and debt ratio, highlight the company's high level of indebtedness. These ratios indicate that Visteon Corporation relies heavily on borrowed funds, which increases its financial risk.

The quick ratio of 0.446 further supports the notion of poor liquidity, as it takes into account only the most liquid assets. The cash ratio of 0.173 implies that a significant portion of the company's assets are not readily available in cash, which can hinder its ability to cover immediate expenses.

Netflix's net profit margin of 0.0047 indicates a low profitability level, suggesting that the company may struggle to generate significant returns on its sales. The pretax profit margin of 0.0084 reinforces this notion, indicating that the company's profitability before taxes is also relatively low.

Furthermore, the debt-equity ratio of 4.328 suggests that Netflix relies heavily on debt to finance its operations, which can increase financial risk. Additionally, the free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of -0.821 indicates that the company is not generating sufficient free cash flow from its operating activities to cover its financial obligations.

Firstly, the current ratio of 1.27 indicates that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. Although it has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities, the ratio is relatively low and suggests a potential liquidity risk.

Secondly, the net profit margin of 3.90% and the pretax profit margin of 5.59% indicate that the company's profitability is relatively low. This implies that Xerox may struggle to generate sufficient profits from its operations.

Furthermore, the debt equity ratio of 1.77 and the debt ratio of 0.63 highlight the company's high level of debt. This indicates that Xerox relies heavily on borrowed funds, which can increase its financial risk and make it more vulnerable to economic downturns.

Additionally, the return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are all relatively low. These indicators suggest that Xerox is not effectively utilizing its assets and capital to generate returns for its shareholders.

Moreover, the cash ratio of 0.23 and the free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of 0.97 indicate that the company may have limited cash reserves and may struggle to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations.

In conclusion, Xerox Holdings Corporation exhibits poor credit status based on its low liquidity, profitability, and efficiency ratios, high debt levels, and limited cash flow generation. These factors indicate potential financial challenges and may impact the company's ability to meet its financial obligations in the long run."

The company's overall credit status is determined by analyzing various aspects of its financial performance. 

Looking at the liquidity ratios, Acco Brands Corporation has a current ratio of 1.97, indicating that it has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The quick ratio of 1.30 further supports the company's ability to meet its immediate financial obligations. However, the cash ratio of 0.13 suggests that the company has a relatively low level of cash reserves, which could pose a risk in times of financial uncertainty.

The company's profitability ratios also contribute to its poor credit status. With a net profit margin of 0.05, Acco Brands Corporation has a relatively low profitability level. The pretax profit margin of 0.08 and operating profit margin of 0.10 also reflect the company's struggle to generate substantial profits from its operations. These figures indicate that the company may be facing challenges in managing its expenses and maximizing its revenues.

Acco Brands Corporation's return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are all below industry averages, further indicating its poor credit status. These ratios reflect the company's inefficiency in utilizing its assets and capital to generate profits for its shareholders.

The debt ratios of the company are also a cause for concern. With a debt-equity ratio of 2.27 and a debt ratio of 0.69, Acco Brands Corporation has a significant amount of debt compared to its equity and assets. This high level of debt increases the company's financial risk and lowers its creditworthiness.

In summary, Acco Brands Corporation is currently facing poor credit due to its low profitability, inefficient asset utilization, and high debt levels. The company needs to focus on improving its profitability, reducing its debt burden, and enhancing its liquidity position to strengthen its credit status."

Several key ratios and margins reflect the company's financial health. The current ratio, which measures the ability to cover short-term obligations, is relatively low at 0.61. This suggests that SCI may struggle to meet its immediate financial obligations. Similarly, the cash ratio is quite low at 0.23, indicating a limited ability to cover short-term liabilities with readily available cash.

Profitability indicators also paint a challenging picture for SCI. The net profit margin, which represents the portion of revenue converted into profit, is relatively low at 0.06. This implies that the company has limited profitability and may struggle to generate significant earnings. The return on assets and return on equity, which measure the efficiency of utilizing assets and equity in generating profits, are also relatively low at 0.01 and 0.10, respectively. This indicates that SCI is not effectively utilizing its resources to generate returns for shareholders.

The debt ratio of 0.89 further highlights the significant proportion of debt in the company's capital structure.

Overall, the combination of low liquidity, limited profitability, and high debt levels suggests that SCI faces significant credit risk.

This conclusion is derived from a combination of factors, such as liquidity, profitability, leverage, and cash flow. 

In terms of liquidity, the company's current ratio of 0.972 indicates that it may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. Additionally, the quick ratio of 1.399 suggests that the company's ability to cover immediate liabilities with its most liquid assets is also limited. The cash ratio of 0.631 further supports this notion, indicating a low level of cash reserves relative to current liabilities.

Profitability metrics also contribute to the poor credit status. The net profit margin of 0.116 signifies a relatively low level of profitability for the company. Similarly, the operating profit margin of 0.220 indicates that MGM Resorts International is not generating substantial profits from its operations. The return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity ratios also exhibit relatively low values, suggesting less efficient utilization of resources and lower returns for investors.

Furthermore, leverage indicators highlight the company's high level of debt. The debt-equity ratio of 3.529 implies a significant reliance on debt financing, potentially increasing financial risk. The debt ratio of 0.779 further reinforces this observation, indicating that a large portion of the company's assets is financed by debt.

Lastly, cash flow indicators also contribute to the poor credit status. The free cash flow operating cash flow ratio of -0.475 suggests that the company's operating cash flow may not be sufficient to support its free cash flow generation. The negative free cash flow per share of -1.282 indicates that MGM Resorts International is utilizing more cash than it is generating, potentially leading to financial strains.

In conclusion, MGM Resorts International currently faces challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, leverage, and cash flow. These factors collectively contribute to its poor credit status, highlighting the need for improvement in various financial areas to enhance its overall creditworthiness."

Furthermore, the free cash flow operating cash flow ratio is negative, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient cash flow from its operations to cover its capital expenditures. This raises concerns about the company's ability to fund its growth or meet its financial obligations.

Firstly, the current ratio of the company is 0.508969491, indicating that it may have difficulties in meeting its short-term obligations. Similarly, the quick ratio of 0.275500851 suggests that the company's ability to pay off its current liabilities using its most liquid assets is relatively weak.

Moving on to profitability ratios, the net profit margin of 0.060 implies that the company's profitability is relatively low. The gross profit margin of 0.736 indicates that the company is generating a decent profit on its sales, but the operating profit margin of 0.078 suggests that the company's operating expenses are relatively high. Furthermore, the return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity ratios all indicate below-average profitability and efficiency in utilizing assets and capital.

The debt ratios of United States Cellular Corporation are also worth mentioning. The debt-equity ratio of 0.982 suggests that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which increases its financial risk. The debt ratio of 0.495 indicates that almost half of the company's assets are financed by debt. This high debt burden could negatively impact the company's creditworthiness.

In conclusion, United States Cellular Corporation's overall credit status is poor. The company's liquidity, profitability, and debt ratios indicate potential financial challenges. It is crucial for the management to address these issues and implement strategies to improve the company's financial performance and creditworthiness."

Additionally, the return on assets (ROA) of 0.057 suggests that the company's assets are generating a relatively low return, which may indicate inefficiency or underperformance.

The company's debt ratios further support the poor credit status. The debt-equity ratio of 1.328 indicates that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which increases its financial risk.

This conclusion is drawn from a combination of several factors that indicate potential financial risks and challenges for the company.

Firstly, the current ratio of 0.56 suggests that W&T Offshore may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. This low ratio indicates a limited ability to cover immediate liabilities with its current assets. Additionally, the quick ratio of 0.36 further reinforces this concern, as it measures the company's ability to meet short-term obligations using its most liquid assets.

Furthermore, the debt-equity ratio of 2.43 and the debt ratio of 0.71 indicate a heavy reliance on debt financing. This high level of debt can pose significant risks to the company's financial health and stability. Additionally, the effective tax rate of 0.35 suggests that the company may be experiencing challenges in managing its tax obligations effectively.

In terms of profitability, the net profit margin of 0.18 and the return on assets of 0.09 indicate relatively modest profitability levels for the company. These figures suggest that W&T Offshore may face challenges in generating sustainable profits from its assets and operations.

Moreover, the operating cash flow sales ratio of 0.54 indicates that the company's operating cash flow may not be sufficient to support its sales revenue. This raises concerns about the company's ability to generate adequate cash flow to fund its operations and future investments.

Overall, considering the low liquidity ratios, high debt levels, modest profitability, and insufficient operating cash flow, the credit status of W&T Offshore, Inc. can be classified as poor. These indicators highlight potential financial risks and suggest a need for careful evaluation and monitoring of the company's financial performance."

However, the quick ratio of 0.9447 indicates that the company has a lower ability to meet its immediate obligations without relying on inventory.

Furthermore, the company's profitability ratios reveal a relatively low net profit margin of 0.0317 and a pretax profit margin of 0.0150, indicating that Sanmina Corporation's ability to generate profits from its operations is relatively weak. The gross profit margin of 0.0786 suggests that the company has a low level of profitability after accounting for the cost of goods sold. 

In terms of efficiency, Sanmina Corporation has an asset turnover of 1.8759, which indicates that the company is generating a moderate amount of sales relative to its total assets. However, the fixed asset turnover of 11.0390 suggests that the company is utilizing its fixed assets efficiently to generate sales.

Additionally, the quick ratio of 1.405 further supports this liquidity assessment.

However, the company's profitability indicators show negative values across the board. The net profit margin, pretax profit margin, gross profit margin, and operating profit margin all indicate losses. This suggests that the company is facing challenges in generating profitability from its operations. 

Furthermore, the return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are also negative, indicating inefficiency in utilizing assets and capital to generate returns for shareholders. The debt equity ratio of 0.698 and debt ratio of 0.408 suggest a moderate level of debt compared to equity, which may have contributed to the negative profitability.

Despite these concerns, the company's asset turnover and fixed asset turnover ratios indicate a relatively efficient utilization of assets. Additionally, the payables turnover ratio of 11.024 suggests that the company effectively manages its payable obligations.

In conclusion, while Kinross Gold Corporation demonstrates good liquidity and efficient asset utilization, its negative profitability indicators raise concerns about its financial performance. The company may need to focus on improving its profitability and reducing its debt burden to strengthen its overall credit status."

Cimarex Energy Co's return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are all negative, indicating that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets and capital to generate profits. The asset turnover ratio of 0.28 implies that the company is generating low revenue relative to its total assets, which may be a contributing factor to its negative profitability ratios.

The company's debt-equity ratio of 0.87 suggests that it has a moderate level of debt compared to its equity. This indicates a relatively balanced capital structure. Cimarex Energy Co's effective tax rate of 0.36 implies that it pays taxes at a moderate rate.

In conclusion, while Cimarex Energy Co demonstrates strong liquidity, efficient credit management, and a balanced capital structure, its negative profitability ratios and low asset turnover indicate areas for improvement.

In conclusion, Graham Holdings Company's overall credit status is poor, primarily due to its low operating profit margin, below-average return on assets and equity, and high debt levels. The company needs to focus on improving its operational efficiency, reducing its debt burden, and optimizing its asset utilization to enhance its creditworthiness in the market."

The company's overall creditworthiness is evaluated by analyzing various metrics that highlight its financial health and performance.

Ciena's current ratio of 2.79 indicates its ability to cover short-term obligations with its current assets. This suggests a relatively strong liquidity position. The quick ratio of 2.21 further supports this, indicating the company's ability to meet immediate financial obligations without relying heavily on inventory. However, the cash ratio of 1.19 signals a relatively low level of cash available to cover short-term liabilities.

Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO) is a measure of the average time taken by customers to pay, and Ciena's DSO of 82.20 days implies a relatively slow collection of receivables. This could potentially impact its cash flow and liquidity position.

Profitability indicators reveal mixed results. The net profit margin of 0.47% indicates low profitability, while the gross profit margin of 43.98% suggests a reasonable level of profitability after deducting direct costs. The operating profit margin of 4.11% indicates that the company has some room for improvement in controlling its operating expenses.

Ciena's return on assets (ROA) of 0.43% shows a relatively low return on its total assets. This suggests that the company may not be generating sufficient profits from its assets. The return on equity (ROE) of 1.88% indicates a relatively low return for shareholders' investments.

The debt-equity ratio of 3.34 indicates a high level of debt compared to equity. This suggests that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which could increase its financial risk. The debt ratio of 76.96% further highlights the company's significant reliance on borrowed funds.

The effective tax rate of 50.90% signifies a relatively high tax burden on the company's profits. This may limit its ability to generate sufficient cash flow for growth and expansion.

Overall, Ciena Corporation's financial indicators demonstrate a poor credit status. While the company exhibits reasonable liquidity and profitability in some areas, its slow collection of receivables, low returns, high debt levels, and high tax burden contribute to its poor credit rating. It is essential for Ciena to address these challenges to improve its financial standing and enhance its creditworthiness."

Several key indicators support this assessment. 

Firstly, TriMas Corporation's net profit margin is relatively low at 0.06, indicating that the company's profitability is weak. This could be due to inefficiencies in cost management or a decline in sales revenue. Additionally, the company's pretax profit margin of 0.07 suggests that TriMas Corporation's earnings before taxes are not substantial.

Furthermore, TriMas Corporation's debt ratio is high at 0.82, implying that the company relies heavily on debt financing. This can be concerning as it indicates a higher risk of default on its financial obligations. The debt-equity ratio of 4.68 also reinforces this concern, suggesting that the company has a significant amount of debt in relation to its equity.

Additionally, the company's cash ratio of 0.40 indicates that TriMas Corporation may have limited cash reserves to cover short-term obligations. This could pose challenges in meeting its financial obligations promptly.

Moreover, TriMas Corporation's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) are relatively low at 0.06 and 0.35, respectively. These figures suggest that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets and shareholders' investments to generate profits.

Overall, the combination of weak profitability, high debt levels, limited cash reserves, and suboptimal return on assets and equity contribute to TriMas Corporation's poor credit status. It is important for the company to address these issues through effective financial management strategies to improve its creditworthiness and mitigate potential risks."

Progressive Corporation demonstrates strong financial health through its current ratio of 2.34, indicating that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its short-term liabilities. This suggests that the company is capable of meeting its financial obligations in the near future.

Furthermore, the quick ratio of 2.34 reaffirms the company's ability to meet its short-term liabilities, as it excludes inventory from current assets. The cash ratio of 0.02 indicates that Progressive Corporation has a relatively low level of cash on hand in relation to its current liabilities, which may warrant further analysis.

The company's profitability ratios are also favorable. With a net profit margin of 0.07, Progressive Corporation is able to generate a significant amount of profit from its operations. The return on equity of 0.17 indicates that the company is utilizing its shareholders' investments efficiently to generate profits.

Progressive Corporation's asset turnover ratio of 0.71 illustrates its ability to generate revenue from its assets. The fixed asset turnover ratio of 17.02 suggests that the company efficiently utilizes its fixed assets to generate revenue.
