The free cash flow per share of $2.25 indicates that Foot Locker has a positive cash flow from its operations and is capable of generating cash to support its business activities. However, the enterprise value multiple of 7.39 suggests that the company's market value may be overestimated compared to its financial performance.

In summary, Foot Locker, Inc. faces challenges in terms of profitability, return on equity, and market valuation. Despite having a favorable current ratio, the company's poor credit status is mainly attributed to its low profit margins, high debt-equity ratio, and limited return on equity. It will be crucial for Foot Locker to address these issues and improve its financial performance to enhance its creditworthiness."

Return on assets, a measure of how efficiently the company is using its assets to generate profit, is at -33753.148. This indicates that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate returns. Additionally, the return on capital employed and return on equity ratios are negative at -60057.887 and 141350.211 respectively, suggesting that the company's investments are not generating adequate returns.

Firstly, the company's current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio are significantly below the ideal threshold, indicating a weak liquidity position. This means that AMC may struggle to meet its short-term financial obligations.

Secondly, the days of sales outstanding metric suggests that the company takes a relatively long time to collect its receivables, which can negatively impact cash flow. Additionally, the net profit margin and pretax profit margin are relatively low, indicating lower profitability compared to industry standards.

The company's binary rating of 0 indicates a lower creditworthiness. 

Several key ratios contribute to this assessment. The current ratio of 2.8576 suggests the company has sufficient current assets to cover its short-term liabilities, which is a positive indicator. However, the quick ratio of 1.6230, which excludes inventory from current assets, indicates a lower ability to meet immediate obligations. The cash ratio of 0.7718 further highlights the limited cash reserves available.

Days of sales outstanding is at 53.4353, showing that the company takes a relatively long time to collect payments from customers. This can strain cash flow and affect liquidity. 

Profitability ratios also contribute to the poor credit status. The net profit margin of -0.0041 indicates that the company is experiencing a loss, making it less attractive to lenders. The pretax profit margin and gross profit margin are also negative, further highlighting the company's financial challenges. 

Return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are negative as well, indicating inefficiency in utilizing assets and generating profits. 

The debt-equity ratio of 1.8612 and debt ratio of 0.6505 suggest a high level of debt relative to equity. This increases financial risk and affects creditworthiness.

The free cash flow operating cash flow ratio is negative, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is not sufficient to cover its free cash flow needs. This raises concerns about the company's ability to meet financial obligations.

Overall, Griffon Corporation's poor credit status is attributed to its lower liquidity, negative profitability, inefficient asset utilization, high debt levels, and negative free cash flow. These factors suggest a higher risk for lenders and potential difficulties in meeting financial obligations."

The company's current ratio of 124.26 indicates a strong ability to cover its short-term liabilities. However, this is offset by its quick ratio of 14.99, which suggests a lower level of liquidity when excluding inventory from current assets. 

The company's cash ratio of 12.67 implies a relatively healthy level of cash reserves, but its days of sales outstanding of 86.41 indicate a longer collection period for receivables, which could potentially strain its cash flow. 

In terms of profitability, Beazer Homes USA, Inc. demonstrates a net profit margin of 0.24, indicating that it generates a reasonable profit from its revenue. However, its pre-tax profit margin is negative at -0.05, suggesting that the company is struggling to generate profits before accounting for taxes. 

The company's return on assets is relatively low at 0.02, indicating that it is not generating significant returns from its invested assets. Furthermore, its return on equity stands at 0.12, suggesting that it is not efficiently utilizing shareholder equity to generate profits. 

Beazer Homes USA, Inc. has a high debt-equity ratio of 6.40, indicating a significant reliance on debt financing. This poses a higher risk to the company as it may face difficulties in meeting its debt obligations. 

Overall, Beazer Homes USA, Inc. faces challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, and leverage. While it has strong current assets and cash reserves, its poor quick ratio and high debt-equity ratio raise concerns.

Several key ratios help evaluate the creditworthiness of a company. The current ratio of 2.31 indicates that IAC has a relatively healthy short-term liquidity position, meaning it has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. Similarly, the quick ratio of 2.06 suggests the company has a good ability to meet its short-term obligations without relying heavily on inventory.

However, the cash ratio of 1.47 indicates that IAC may have a lower level of cash on hand to cover its immediate liabilities. This could potentially pose a risk if the company experiences unexpected expenses or a decrease in revenue.

The days of sales outstanding, which is a measure of how long it takes for the company to collect its accounts receivable, is relatively low at 27.71 days. This indicates that IAC is efficient in collecting payments from its customers, which is a positive sign for its creditworthiness.

Profitability ratios also provide insight into the company's credit status. The net profit margin of 13.34% suggests that IAC is generating a reasonable profit from its operations. Additionally, the return on equity of 20.83% indicates that the company is generating a good return for its shareholders.

However, the company's debt-equity ratio of 1.15 and debt ratio of 0.53 indicate that IAC has a relatively high level of debt compared to its equity. This could potentially make the company more vulnerable to financial distress and negatively impact its creditworthiness.

In summary, while IAC demonstrates strong liquidity and profitability ratios, its relatively low cash ratio and high debt levels contribute to its poor credit status. It is important for the company to closely monitor its cash position and debt levels to ensure its long-term financial stability and improve its creditworthiness."

Several key indicators point towards this conclusion.

Firstly, the current ratio of 0.586 suggests that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. A current ratio below 1 indicates a potential liquidity issue. Similarly, the quick ratio of 0.572 further highlights the company's vulnerability to meet immediate financial obligations.

Furthermore, the debt-equity ratio of 2.896 indicates a significant reliance on debt financing, which poses a risk to the company's financial stability. A high debt ratio of 0.743 further supports this concern. This heavy reliance on debt can increase the financial burden on the company and impact its ability to generate profits.

The net profit margin of 0.055 and the pretax profit margin of 0.084 suggest that the company's profitability is relatively low. These margins indicate that the company is not efficiently converting its revenue into profits.

Moreover, the return on assets of 0.027 and the return on equity of 0.106 demonstrate that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets and shareholder investments to generate returns. These ratios indicate a lack of efficiency in the company's operations and a potential inability to generate satisfactory returns for its investors.

However, it is important to note that this ratio alone does not paint a complete picture of the company's creditworthiness.

Another concerning indicator is the net profit margin, which stands at -0.01. This negative value implies that the company is currently operating at a loss. Similarly, the pre-tax profit margin is also negative, indicating that the company's profitability is further impacted by taxes.

AAM's return on assets (ROA) of 0.031 and return on capital employed (ROCE) of 0.037 are also relatively low. These ratios indicate that the company is not efficiently utilizing its assets and capital to generate returns.

Additionally, AAM's high debt-equity ratio of 89.149 and debt ratio of 0.989 raise concerns about its financial leverage. These figures indicate that the company relies heavily on debt to finance its operations, which can increase financial risks.

Lastly, the negative effective tax rate of -0.095 suggests that AAM is potentially facing tax-related issues, which can further impact its financial performance.

In summary, based on the provided financial indicators, American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. is facing a poor credit status. The company's liquidity position, profitability, return on investment, and high debt levels all contribute to its unfavorable credit status. These factors highlight potential financial risks and challenges for AAM."

Firstly, the current ratio of 1.28 indicates that TransAlta may struggle to meet its short-term obligations. Ideally, a higher current ratio would be preferred, suggesting that the company has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. 

The quick ratio of 0.82 further emphasizes the company's liquidity concerns. This ratio measures the ability to pay off short-term obligations using only the most liquid assets. A ratio below 1 indicates potential difficulties in meeting immediate financial obligations.

However, its quick ratio, a more stringent measure of liquidity, is only 0.95, suggesting that the company may struggle to pay off its immediate liabilities without relying on inventory. 

PVH Corp.'s profitability margins are also a concern. The net profit margin is 5.33%, indicating that the company earns a modest profit on each dollar of sales. The gross profit margin, which measures the profitability of the company's core operations, is 52.50%. This suggests that PVH Corp. faces significant costs in its supply chain or production process. Additionally, the operating profit margin is 4.75%, indicating that the company's operating expenses are relatively high compared to its revenue.

The company's return on assets (ROA) and return on capital employed (ROCE) are 4.02% and 4.12%, respectively.

Furthermore, CoreLogic's cash ratio is relatively low, indicating a limited ability to cover immediate liabilities with cash. The days of sales outstanding, which measures the average number of days it takes for the company to collect payments from customers, is relatively high, suggesting potential difficulties in receiving payments promptly.

In terms of profitability, CoreLogic's net profit margin is modest, indicating that the company generates a relatively low level of profit from its revenue. The return on assets, return on capital employed, and return on equity are all below average, highlighting the company's inefficiency in utilizing its assets and capital to generate returns for shareholders.

CoreLogic also faces significant leverage risk, as indicated by its high debt-equity ratio and debt ratio. These ratios suggest that the company relies heavily on debt financing, potentially increasing its financial vulnerability.

It is worth noting that CoreLogic's fixed asset turnover is relatively high, suggesting effective utilization of its fixed assets to generate revenue. However, this positive aspect is overshadowed by the company's overall poor credit status.

In summary, CoreLogic, Inc. currently exhibits poor credit status. The company faces challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, and leverage risk. Addressing these areas of concern will be crucial for the company to improve its credit standing and financial performance."

Overall, based on the provided financial indicators, DCP Midstream LP's credit status appears to be poor. The company faces challenges in terms of liquidity, profitability, and efficient utilization of resources. The high debt levels also indicate potential financial risk. It is important for the company to address these concerns and devise strategies to improve its creditworthiness."
